		<h1>Running the Programs</h1>
		<p>
			In this section, each script's functions and arguments are
			discussed. There is a set of common arguments that some of the
			scripts accept, and of course, each has its own idiosyncrasies,
			too.
		</p>
		<p>
			The following arguments are common to most of the components of
			Cricket.
		</p>
		<dl>
			<dt><tt>-logLevel</tt></dt>
			<dd>
				<p>
					Default value: <i>info</i> (except grapher.cgi, where it
					defaults to <i>warn</i>)
				</p>
				<p>
					The possible values are "error", "warn", "info", or
					"debug". Each setting includes the output created by any
					of the preceding settings. All diagnostic output goes to
					the standard error stream.
				</p>
			</dd>
			<dt><tt>-base</tt></dt>
			<dd>
				<p>Default value: <i>$HOME/cricket-config</i></p>
				<p>
					You can use this setting to use a different config tree.
					Experience shows, however, that it's simplest to just
					accept the defaults and install Cricket in an account of
					its own.
				</p>
			</dd>
		</dl>
		<p>
			Here's a brief description of each program, and what arguments
			it takes.
		</p>
		<dl>
			<dt><tt>collector</tt></dt>
			<dd>
				<p>
					Collector is the script that runs every five minutes
					from cron in order to traverse the config tree, fetch
					data, and enter it into the RRD files. It's also used
					interactively to test configurations, and to convert
					old-style RRD files to RRD 1.x.x files.
				</p>
				<p>
					The collector will process only the subtrees listed on
					the command line, unless there are none, in which case
					it will process the entire config tree.
				</p>
				<p>
					Except during testing, collector is usually run from
					collect-subtrees, which takes care of creating the huge
					command lines collector sometimes needs, and does other
					housekeeping jobs.  When testing a new subtree of the
					config-tree, you can use a command like
					"$HOME/cricket/collector -logLevel debug /new-tree".
					Once you are certain the subtree is functioning
					correctly, you can add it to the collect-subtrees config
					file, and rely on collect-subtrees to run the collector
					for you.
				</p>
				<p>
					The collector will always run in two stages: collecting
					the data and checking thresholds for monitoring. If you
					for some reason do not need or want the threshold
					monitoring, you can specify the <tt>-skipMonitor</tt>
					option. Good reasons not to run this second phase
					include:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						Cricket is first run, or has been down for more that
						your heartbeat interval, and you want to avoid
						threshold alarms because of NaN values.
					</li>
					<li>
						You don't use threshold monitoring at all and want
						to avoid the overhead of scanning for it.
					</li>
					<li>
						You run your collector more frequently than once
						every five minutes, and don't want the overhead for
						the "intermediate" runs.
					</li>
				</ul>
			</dd>
			<dt><tt>grapher.cgi</tt></dt>
			<dd>
				<p>Accepts common arguments.</p>
				<p>
					The grapher is almost never run from the command line,
					so options parsing is basically a moot point. The CGI
					script should get run by the web server automatically in
					response to accesses to files that end in CGI. Consult
					your web server documentation to find out how to make it
					work like this.
				</p>
				<p>
					Because it's not generally possible to control the
					command line of grapher.cgi, it's critical that it
					either defaults to the correct base directory, or that
					it has the base directory hardcoded internally to it.
					The default base directory is $HOME/cricket-config.
					However, $HOME will only be set right if Cricket can
					guess it's username from it's URL. If there's any doubt,
					you should hard code the base directory by editing the
					first few lines of grapher.cgi.
				</p>
			</dd>
			<dt><tt>configure</tt></dt>
			<dd>
				<p>Accepts no arguments at this time.</p>
				<p>
					This is basically a placeholder for when Cricket is more
					complicated (say it ain't so!) and requires an
					autoconf-generated configure script. At this point, it
					can point all the Cricket scripts at your Perl install,
					which is very helpful for sites which do not have Perl
					installed in a standard location.
