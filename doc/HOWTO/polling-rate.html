    <h1>Modifying the Polling Rate</h1>
    <p class="intro">
      This document provides some help for getting Jeff Allen's
      <a href="http://cricket.sf.net/">Cricket</a>
      <abbr title="Simple Network Management Protocol">SNMP</abbr>
      monitoring package to use a custom poll interval such as one minute
      instead of five. This is a revised version of Theresa Hilding's
      excellent guide which was written in 2000.
    </p>
    <p class="note">
      Modifying <abbr title="Round Robin Database">RRD</abbr> or
      <abbr title="Round Robin Archive">RRA</abbr> parameters can render your
      archived data useless. Be carefull and read this entire document before
      you start making changes!

      <h2>Add new RRA definitions</h2>
      <p>
        The first thing is to create new RRA definitions. The current defaults
        are in the toplevel &ldquo;Defaults&rdquo; file. I left those as is
        and created a new subtree <code class="inline">/router-1min</code>
        with the new RRA definitions in the <code
          class="inline">/router-1min</code> &ldquo;Defaults&rdquo; file. The
        definitions are completely dependent on what type of data you want to
        keep and how long you want to store it. See the RRDTool create
        function documentation for details.
      </p>
      <code class="block">
  # one point every minute for 2 days 
  rra     1minAve         AVERAGE:0.5:1:1880 

  # one point every 30 minutes for 1 week, both average and maximum
  rra     30minAves1      AVERAGE:0.5:30:336 
  rra     30minMaxs1      MAX:0.5:30:336 

  # one point every 2 hours for 50 days, both average and maximum 
  rra     2hrAves1        AVERAGE:0.5:120:600 
  rra     2hrMaxs1        MAX:0.5:120:600 

  # one point every day for 600 days, both average and maximum 
  rra     1dayAves1       AVERAGE:0.5:1440:600 
  rra     1dayMaxs1       MAX:0.5:1440:600 
      </code>

      <h2>Add the new RRA definitions to the targetType Dictionary.</h2>
      <p>
        Add the new rra definitions to the targetType dictionary for the
        target you want to monitor.
      </p>
      <p>
        Here is my definition from my <code class="inline">/router-1min</code>
        &ldquo;Defaults&rdquo; file. For this particular router interface I am
        interested only in &ldquo;<code
          class="inline">ifInOctets</code>&rdquo; and &ldquo;<code
          class="inline">ifOutOctets</code>&rdquo; at 1 minute intervals. The
        actual datasource definitions for &ldquo;<code
          class="inline">ifInOctets</code>&rdquo; and &ldquo;<code
          class="inline">ifOutOctets</code>&rdquo; are still
        in the rootlevel Defaults file.
      </p>
      <code class="block">
  targetType      1min-router-interface 
    ds   = "inInOctets, inOutOctets" 
    view = "Octets: inInOctets ifOutOctets"
    rra  = "1minAve, 30minAves1, 30minMaxs1, 2hrAves1,
            2hrMaxs1, 1dayAves1, 1dayMaxs1" 
      </code>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h2>Modify rrd-poll-interval in the target dictionary</h2>
      <p>
        This is from my <code class="inline">/router-1min</code>
        &ldquo;Defaults&rdquo; file.
      </p>
      <code class="block">
  Target  --default-- 
    inst              = map(interface-name) 
    snmp-community    = secret 
    snmp-host         = %router% 
    target-type       = 1min-router-interface 
    rrd-poll-interval = 60 
      </code>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h2>Modify your crontab</h2>
      <p>Modify cron update times to run every minute of the hour.</p>
    </div>
    <p>Hopefully that's it.  Enjoy.</p>
