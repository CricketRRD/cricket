    <h1>Understanding Instance Mapping</h1>
    <p>
      Cricket has a nifty feature called instance mapping. Basically it's
      meant to take the busywork out of monitoring SNMP devices. In this
      document, you'll learn far more than you ever wanted to know about it.
    </p>

    <div>
      <h2>The Problem</h2>
      <p>
        In the SNMP world, when something is stored in a table, each table row
        has a number. These numbers, called instance numbers, are used to
        reference the rows. Since routers typically have lots of interfaces,
        they are stored in a table, indexed by these instance numbers. I can
        ask a router to give me the traffic measurements from row number 4,
        and it will know what I mean and go do it. However, when we humans
        think about router interfaces, we don't think about instance numbers.
        We think about some other identifier for the row, like the interface
        name or the IP address.
      </p>
      <p>
        Interface mapping lets you configure Cricket to talk to devices based
        on one of the other keys in this table. The mapping part comes in when
        Cricket turns the key you give it into an instance number. It does
        this in an efficient way, which is guaranteed to be right no matter
        what kind of row re-arranging goes on on the router. (It seems cruel,
        but they are allowed to re-arrange their rows at any time. This would
        presumably <em>not</em> be part of what makes SNMP
        &ldquo;simple&rdquo;.)
      </p>
    </div>
    
    <div>
      <h2>What does this mean to me?</h2>
      <p>
        Nothing, as long as you are using the sample config tree's
        &ldquo;<code>router-interface</code>&rdquo; subtree. It comes ready to
        automatically do interface mapping using the interfaces name as a key.
        When you use &ldquo;<code>listInterfaces</code>&rdquo; to make an
        interfaces file, it will set the
        &ldquo;<code>interface-name</code>&rdquo; tag for you, and Cricket
        will use that to do the instance mapping automatically.
      </p>
      <p>
        On the other hand, if you want to setup Cricket to use a different key
        (say, the IP address, or maybe the human-readable descriptions Cisco
        routers support), or to monitor something else via SNMP that lives in
        tables, then you need to read on and understand the
        &ldquo;<code>map</code>&rdquo; dictionary, and how it is used to
        control the interface mapping algorithm.
      </p>
    </div>
    
    <div>
      <h2>The Icky Details</h2>
      <p>
        When Cricket comes across an instance number which looks like
        &ldquo;<code>map(interface-name)</code>&rdquo;, then it knows that
        instead of using a hard-coded instance number, or an instance set, it
        will be using the instance mapping code to find the instance number.
        It uses the part inside the parenthesis
        (&ldquo;<code>interface-name</code>&rdquo; in the case above) to find
        an entry in the &ldquo;<code>map</code>&rdquo; dictionary that it can
        use to help map the given key to an instance number.
      </p>
      <p>
        There are two interesting tags in a &ldquo;<code>map</code>&rdquo;
        entry that control this process. The first is the
        &ldquo;<code>baseOID</code>&rdquo;, which tells Cricket which column
        of which table it is going to be looking through to find the match.
        For the &ldquo;<code>interface-name</code>&rdquo; map, this is set to
        &ldquo;<code>ifDescr</code>&rdquo;. Cricket will look up the name
        &ldquo;<code>ifDescr</code>&rdquo; in the OID table, and will use the
        resulting OID as the base-oid for an SNMP walk of the table.
      </p>
      <p>
        The other interesting tag is &ldquo;<code>match</code>&rdquo;, which
        is a string that the fetched column will be compared to. This string
        is expanded with respect to the target dictionary, so you can use the
        &ldquo;<code>%tag%</code>&rdquo; syntax there. In the sample config,
        we compare the &ldquo;<code>ifDescr</code>&rdquo; column of the
        interface table to &ldquo;<code>%interface-name%</code>&rdquo;, which
        gets expanded to the current value of the the tag
        &ldquo;<code>interface-name</code>&rdquo; in the current target. If
        the string starts and ends with the slash character, then it is used
        as a Perl regular expression and a case-insensitive regular expression
        match is done, instead of a simple string match. Use this feature only
        when necessary. A string match is preferable, since it has less
        overhead.
      </p>
      <p>
        The system is efficient and accurate. It uses a file sitting
        right next to your RRD file to store the last-used index
        (avoiding gratuitous table-scans) and uses an internal cache
        to minimize table-scans, should they be necessary. It is
        accurate because every time Cricket fetches data using a
        cached instance number, it also fetches the key in the same
        packet. If the key no longer matches, then the cache is
        invalidated, a table-scan is done to map the instance
        number, and the data is re-fetched using the new instance
        number.  The maximum cost of this system is one table-scan
        per host anytime an instance changes, and one extra variable
        fetched per target.
      </p>
      <p>
        Instance mapping is only enabled when the
        &ldquo;<code>inst</code>&rdquo; tag starts with
        &ldquo;<code>map(</code>&rdquo;. This means that hard-coded instances
        and instance ranges are still completely supported, if you are not
        ready to use the instance mapping feature.
      </p>
    </div>
    
    <div>
      <h2>The Ickiest Details</h2>
      <p>
        The SNMP queries done by the instance mapping algorithm are
        implemented semi-independently from the rest of Cricket's
        datasource management code. This is partly because it was
        easier to implement that way, and partly because instance
        mapping is an intrinsically SNMP-thing, and it probably will
        never make sense to talk about using instance mapping with
        an exec datasource.
      </p>
      <p>
        When it comes time to do a table scan, the instance mapping code uses
        the tag named &ldquo;<code>snmp</code>&rdquo; from the current target
        to find the community string, host, and port for the SNMP transaction.
         As discussed above, the snmp tag, by convention, has the community
        string, host, and port in it in a format ready to plug into SNMP
        ds-sources. Thus, even if you've come up with a different way to
        encode community string, host, and port into your datasources, you
        still need to have a tag named snmp for the instance mapping code to
        use.
      </p>
      <p>
        The moral of the story is to try very hard to not mess with the
        sample-config tree (the quote &ldquo;Though this be madness, let there
        be a method in it.&rdquo; comes to mind&hellip;).  It's setup the way
        it is for a reason, and though you may be able to make it more
        efficient in some ways, you won't end up with a config tree that is as
        flexible and broadly-applicable. Thus, I might do something later
        which breaks your config tree without meaning to do so. And I won't
        feel very sorry about it, now that you know better.
