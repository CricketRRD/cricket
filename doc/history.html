      Cricket did not spring, fully formed, from my fingers late one
      night. Granted, most of it did come about late at night, but
      that's just the way I work. Cricket is the result of using and in
      some cases being limited by MRTG, all the while getting more and
      more addicted to it.

      <h2>RRD Tool is Born</h2>
      <p>
        In January 1998, Tobias Oetiker released some of the first
        versions of the RRD tool. I took a look at this work and
        immediately recognized that half of my problems with MRTG
        would be solved by switching to using RRD as the backend,
        instead of rateup, the old backend for MRTG. RRD was designed
        to be much more flexible and much higher performance than
        rateup. However, RRD did not promise to make any dent at all
        in the complexity of our MRTG configuration, nor was it
        immediately obvious how we could extend MRTG to take advantage
        of RRD's new flexibility. 
      </p>

      <h2>The Config Tree is Born</h2>
      <p>
        During the Spring of 1998, Tobias continued to work on RRD,
        but little work was being done to integrate it into a future
        version of MRTG. There are only so many hours in a day,
        after-all, and Tobias does need to earn a living too. I kept
        thinking about the problems facing WebTV, and how we could
        best put to use the really neat RRD tool while solving our
        config file (and, to a lesser extent, parallelization)
        problems. The answer was the config tree. After writing a
        small proof of concept, I sold my bosses on paying a contractor
        (Emmett Hogan) from Global Networking and Computing (<a
          href="http://www.gnac.com">http://www.gnac.com</a>) to
        implement the design for an RRD frontend using the config tree
        idea. This project was to be a six week job, starting around
        July, 1998. This new frontend for RRD came to be called Super
        MRTG, or SMRTG. 
      </p>
      <p>
        As is often (almost always?) the case, it was very hard to
        predict how much time would actually be required to do the
        job. During Emmett's work, we learned a bunch more about how
        we wanted the final system to work. Emmett's finished product
        was still not ready to replace MRTG here at WebTV, and we were
        not ready to release it to the world. I took over SMRTG and
        added the features we needed to put it into production at
        WebTV. I also released a few versions of SMRTG to the
        MRTG-developers mailing list for review. 
      </p>
      <p>
        About this point a number of things happened. First, I
        realized that I was really unhappy with the name SMRTG for
        several reasons. It was too cumbersome, the project is only
        tangentially about routers at this point, and there was not
        a line of MRTG code in SMRTG -- it only <i>looked</i> the
        same. Thus, we needed a new name. I called it Cricket because
        it popped into mind. It's short and catchy, and there seems to
        be no other piece of network management software called
        Cricket. A very long time ago, there once was a really cool
        piece of graphing software for the Mac called Cricket Graph.
        That might have tickled my subconscious, though I only
        remembered it once people started referring to the output of
        Cricket as "Cricket Graphs". 
      </p>
      <p>
        Also, Tobias and I talked about Cricket's, RRD's, and MRTG's
        futures. We agreed that Cricket and RRD made good partners,
        but that RRD is useful on it's own too. (Thus, RRD and Cricket
        will be distributed separately for the foreseeable future.) We
        also agreed that it made no sense for him to duplicate my
        effort on the frontend, so it's unlikely there will ever be a
        version of MRTG that uses RRD as it's backend. Instead, we
        will try to help people convert to using Cricket if they need
        the performance of RRD. (And who doesn't!) As you can see from
        this history, Cricket would not exist if it wasn't for MRTG
        and RRD, two of Tobias' ultra-cool inventions. I am deeply
        indebted to that giant for letting me stand on his shoulders. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Cricket was unveiled to the public as part of 
        <a href="http://www.usenix.org/events/neta99">Usenix's First
          Conference on Network Administration</a>. I submitted
        <a href="neta-paper/paper.html">a paper</a> on Cricket there,
        and released a version that people started to rely on. During
        the rest of 1999, the Cricket-users mailing list slowly grew
        from 100 through 400. During 1999 Cricket changed little, even
        though lots of users submitted patches. That was mostly due to
        me getting a new job and Cricket losing some of it's novelty
        value for me. 
      </p>
      <p>
        I gave an invited talk at 
        <a href="http://www.usenix.org/events/lisa99">Usenix's LISA 99</a>
        which featured Cricket, along with <a
          href="http://www.gnac.com/four-star">other tools</a>
        I have worked on at WebTV. At LISA, I was invited to give a
        talk on Cricket at <a href="http://www.nluug.nl/events/sane2000">SANE
        2000</a>. Word of Cricket spread, and it was written up in both
        <a href="http://www.sysadminmag.com">Sysadmin Magazine</a>
        and <a href="http://cricket.sf.net/press/webreview/webreview-1.htm">WebReview.com</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Around January 2000, I decided that the Cricket users deserved
        to have better support, and what better way to do that than to
        turn the project over to the community at large? I got a
        project on Sourceforge and worked, slowly, through the spring
        of 2000 to move things over. My goal was to release 1.0.0 in
        time for the talk at SANE 2000. More importantly, my goal was
        to setup a CVS tree that would allow us to actively develop
        Cricket going forward. I seem to have succeeded. My co-worker
        Adam Meltzer has already been working hard at adding features
        to the 1.1.x branch, which will be ready for beta tests this
        summer.
      </p>
      <p>
        Today, in May 2000, Cricket is installed on three separate
        servers at WebTV and is monitoring about 9000 targets, with
        over 50 different target types represented. Cricket takes data
        from SNMP, shell scripts, and files. Data gathered via scripts
        comes in via syslog, application-specific event streams, HTTP,
        rcp, and 2400 baud serial. WebTV operations folks know that if
        they want to know the health of something they should ask
        Cricket, and if it's not there, they should ask "Why Not!?!".
        During peak times, Cricket has time and again given us
        unprecedented visibility into the health of the WebTV Service.
        It has paid for itself, and we genuinely hope it will be as
        productive at your site.
