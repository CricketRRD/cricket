    <h1>Installing Cricket for the Complete Beginner</h1>
    <p>
      This file in intended to help a total beginner get his first
      installation of Cricket up and running. 
    </p>
    <p>
      If you follow the steps below carefully, you will have a a minimal
      installation, following a standard layout. From here, you can
      explore on your own. When you need help, it will be easy for
      others to help you, since they will be familiar with the beginner
      setup. 
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>
          Ensure you have the right version of Perl. You should be using Perl
          5.6 or higher. You can check by running &ldquo;<code>perl -V</code>&rdquo;.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Ensure you are on a supported platform. For your purposes as a
          beginner, any Unix should work. Cricket also runs on Windows NT 4.0
          and Windows 2000. This document assumes a Unix platform.
          Unfortunately, there is no comparable document for beginners on the
          Windows platform. The instructions in <a
          href="win2kwmi.html">Installing Cricket on Win2K to Monitor WMI
          Counters</a> will help with installation, then refer to this
          document to learn about the config tree. Do your best to translate
          Unix commands in this document to their Windows counterparts (i.e.
          Windows' &ldquo;<code>xcopy</code>&rdquo; can replace Unix'
          &ldquo;<code>cp -r</code>&rdquo;).
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Install the modules you need. You need to install the
          following Perl modules for Cricket to work correctly.

        <p>
          Don't forget to run &ldquo;<code>make site-perl-install</code>&rdquo;
          when installing <abbr title="Round Robin database">RRD</abbr>!
        </p>
        <p>
          Modules marked with <abbr title="Comprehensive Perl Archive
          Network">CPAN</abbr> come from the &ldquo;<dfn>Comprehensive Perl
          Archive Network</dfn>&rdquo;. If you don't know where to find a
          <abbr title="Comprehensive Perl Archive Network">CPAN</abbr>
          site or how to install modules, take a look at the <a
            href="http://search.cpan.org/faq.html"><abbr
            title="Comprehensive Perl Archive Network">CPAN</abbr>
          <abbr title="Frequently Asked Questions">FAQ</abbr></a>. 
        </p>
        <p>
          You may also be able to use &ldquo;<code>CPAN.pm</code>&rdquo; to
          quickly and easily install modules. Type
          &ldquo;<code>perldoc CPAN</code>&rdquo; to learn more about it.
          Cricket ships with a <abbr
            title="Comprehensive Perl Archive Network">CPAN</abbr>-style
          &ldquo;Bundle&rdquo; which should make it simple to install the
          modules you need. The magic command to do this is: 
        </p>
        <code class="block">
% cd cricket/lib
% perl -I. -MCPAN -e 'install Bundle::CricketPrereq'
        </code>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Choose a user to run Cricket. Many sites create a
          special user to run Cricket, but that's not necessary.
          If you choose to run Cricket from your own account
          understand that there will be several directories in
          your home directory that Cricket needs. Learn to live
          with them until you know how to move them elsewhere, or
          use a dedicated user for Cricket so that the directories
          won't bug you. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Do <em>not</em> run Cricket as the
          &ldquo;<code>root</code>&rdquo; user. Superuser privileges are not
          necessary to run Cricket, and granting them would very probably
          create a security hole on your system. 
        </p>
        <p>
          If you use a dedicated user for Cricket make certain that
          mail sent to that user ends up in your mailbox. Some of
          Cricket's runtime errors get reported (with cron's help)
          via e-mail. 
        </p>
        <p>
          In the examples, this will be the user named
          &ldquo;<code>cricket</code>&rdquo;.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Extract the tarfile and run configure. Well, you seem to have
          already done this, since you are reading this file. Please make
          certain the expanded directory tree is in the home directory of the
          user that will be running Cricket. For example, if this was Cricket
          version 1.0.0, it would look like this: 
        </p>
        <code class="block">
% cd ~cricket/
% gunzip -c cricket-1.0.0.tar.gz | tar xvf -
        </code>
        <p>
          You now need to run &ldquo;<code>sh configure</code>&rdquo;
          from &ldquo;<code>$HOME/cricket-1.0.0</code>&rdquo;:
        </p>
        <code class="block">
% cd ~cricket/cricket-1.0.0
% sh configure
        </code>
        <p>
          This will fix the Perl scripts to work in your environment.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Make a softlink to the version you are running. To make
          it easier to upgrade later you'll want to make a link
          from a generic name to the specific name you are
          currently running.
        </p>
        <p>To do this:</p>
        <code class="block">
% cd ~cricket/
% ln -s cricket-1.0.0 cricket
        </code> 
        <p>
          This makes it so that you can refer to things in
          &ldquo;<code>$HOME/cricket/</code>&rdquo;, and still get the version
          1.0.0 copies of those files. You'll then be able to swing that link
          over to newer versions as they become available. 
        </p>
        <p>
          If you don't have a &ldquo;<code>cricket-conf.pl</code>&rdquo; file
          yet, copy the example file
          &ldquo;<code>cricket-conf.pl.sample</code>&rdquo; to
          &ldquo;<code>cricket-conf.pl</code>&rdquo;, and edit it. You will
          need to set &ldquo;<code>$gCricketHome</code>&rdquo; to the home
          directory of the user that Cricket runs as (this is used to locate
          the &ldquo;<code>cricket-config/</code>&rdquo; directory, among
          other things).
        </p>
        <p>
          The &ldquo;<code>$gInstallRoot</code>&rdquo; variable should point
          to where the Cricket scripts are. It is recommended to point this to
          the symlink, so that you can just copy this file if you upgrade
          Cricket later. If you followed the instructions so far,
          &ldquo;<code>$gInstallRoot</code>&rdquo; will be set correctly
          without changing the sample, so
          &ldquo;<code>cricket-conf.pl</code>&rdquo; will contain these two
          lines: 
        </p>
        <code class="block">
$gCricketHome = "/home/cricket";
$gInstallRoot = "$gCricketHome/cricket";
        </code>
        <p>
          There usually is no need to set
          &ldquo;<code>$gConfigRoot</code>&rdquo; explicitly, so leave that
          line commented out. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Usually, there is no need to touch anything else in this file.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Copy the &ldquo;<code>sample-config/</code>&rdquo; tree and modify
          it for your site. Copy the files you intend to use from the
          &ldquo;<code>sample-config/</code>&rdquo; tree from the cricket
          distribution to &ldquo;<code>$HOME/cricket-config</code>&rdquo;. You
          can use&hellip;
        </p>
        <code class="block">
% cd ~cricket
% cp -r cricket/sample-config cricket-config
        </code>
        <p>
          &hellip;but the parts of the tree you won't be using immediately may
          cause some (otherwise harmless) warnings later on. If you don't copy
          the entire tree, make sure to at least include the top level
          &ldquo;<code>Defaults</code>&rdquo; file! Let's focus on two
          subtrees, &ldquo;<code>routers</code>&rdquo; and
          &ldquo;<code>router-interfaces</code>&rdquo;. If you can get these
          going, you'll be able to get others going too. 
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Setup the &ldquo;<code>routers</code>&rdquo; subtree. Go into the
          &ldquo;<code>routers</code>&rdquo; tree and look at the targets
          file. This is where you want to tell Cricket which router to talk
          to. 
        </p>
        <p class="note">
          Note: As far as beginners are concerned, statistics are only
          available from <a href="http://www.cisco.com/">Cisco</a> routers. If
          you have another kind of router, you should skip to the
          &ldquo;<code>router-interfaces</code>&rdquo; step for now. Later,
          when you understand the system better, you can come back and use
          contributed configurations from other Cricket users with hardware
          like yours to make your &ldquo;<code>routers</code>&rdquo; subtree
          work. 
        </p>
        <p>
          You will be editing the file &ldquo;<code>Targets</code>&rdquo; to
          tell Cricket about your router. You want to change these lines: 
        </p>
        <code class="block">
target engineering-router
  target-type = Cisco-7500-Router
  short-desc  = "Router for engineering folks"
        </code> 
        <p>
          You should change the words
          &ldquo;<code>engineering-router</code>&rdquo; in the first line to
          the hostname of the router you want to talk to. If it has not been
          assigned a hostname, you need to stop and do that (perhaps by simply
          editing &ldquo;<code>/etc/hosts</code>&rdquo;) before configuring
          Cricket for the first time. Cricket can talk to things via an IP
          address, but configuring it that way is beyond the scope of this
          document. 
        </p>
        <p>
          You should change the words
          &ldquo;<code>Cisco-7500-Router</code>&rdquo; to reflect the kind of
          router you have. You can choose from this list: 
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>&ldquo;<code>Cisco-2500-Router</code>&rdquo;</li>
          <li>&ldquo;<code>Cisco-3600-Router</code>&rdquo;</li>
          <li>&ldquo;<code>Cisco-7200-Router</code>&rdquo;</li>
          <li>&ldquo;<code>Cisco-7500-Router</code>&rdquo;</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          If your router type is not on this list, choose
          &ldquo;<code>Cisco-2500-Router</code>&rdquo; for now. You can
          experiment with other types later, if you want. The only difference
          is the amount of information you get about ambient temperature where
          the router is installed. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Comment out the other target in that file
          (&ldquo;<code>main-router</code>&rdquo;) using the Cricket comment
          symbol &ldquo;<code>#</code>&rdquo;.
        </p>
        <p>
          Finally, if you are not using the default SNMP community string,
          &ldquo;<code>public</code>&rdquo;, you need to tell Cricket what
          community string to use. Since a community string is something that
          is usually shared across many network devices, it should live at a
          higher place in the config tree.
        </p>
        <p>
          This is a useful feature of the config tree &mdash; it lets you move
          things that apply to lots of targets to a single place (higher in
          the config tree) where it will be easier to maintain. To set the
          community string for your installation, edit the the root
          &ldquo;<code>Defaults</code>&rdquo; file, which is
          &ldquo;<code>~/cricket-config/Default</code>&rdquo;. It has a
          section like this in it:
        </p>
        <code class="block">
Target --default--
  snmp-community = public
  [&hellip;]
        </code>
        <p>
          Change &ldquo;<code>public</code>&rdquo; to your community string.
          Write the file and exit.
        </p>
        <p>
          After you make any changes to the config tree, you need to
          compile it. Storing it in a compiled form makes accessing
          it quicker and easier. Do this: 
        </p>
        <code class="block">% ~/cricket/compile</code>
        <p>
          If the compile command give you any errors, stop at this point and
          fix the problem. This is a good time to check to make sure you are
          logged in to the Cricket user account (try out the
          &ldquo;<code>whoami</code>&rdquo; command and see what it says).
          Check the <a href="http://cricket.sf.net/support/FAQ/">FAQ</a> for
          more help with errors often seen in this step. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, you are ready to try out your configuration. We will
          run the collector by hand on just this subtree first to
          see if there were any errors. 
        </p>
        <code class="block">% ~/cricket/collector /routers</code>
        <p>
          You should see something like this on screen, though this
          example was wrapped by hand for readability: 
        </p>
        <code class="block">
[25-Jan-1999 15:21:20 ] Starting collector: Cricket version 0.64 (Fri May 14 14:14:28 PDT 1999)

        </code>
        <p>
          You can add the arguments &ldquo;<code>-logLevel debug</code>&rdquo;
          on to the end of the command-line to get more information to help to
          solve problems.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Set up the &ldquo;<code>router-interfaces</code>&rdquo; subtree. We
          will setup the &ldquo;<code>router-interfaces</code>&rdquo; subtree
          in much the same way that we set up the routers subtree. However,
          there's a tool to help us avoid the grunt work. This tool is called
          &ldquo;<code>listInterfaces</code>&rdquo;, and it comes in the
          &ldquo;<code>util/</code>&rdquo; directory. 
        </p>
        <p>
          &ldquo;<code>listInterfaces</code>&rdquo; one or two arguments. It
          must have a router name as the first argument, and it can take a
          community string as the second argument. If you do not specify the
          community string, it defaults to &ldquo;<code>public</code>&rdquo;.
        </p>
        <p>
          When you run &ldquo;<code>listInterfaces</code>&rdquo;
          against a router, it will
          print a Cricket config to it's standard output. Thus,
          you can use it like this to save some work: 
        </p>
        <code class="block">% ~/cricket/util/listInterfaces engineering-router > interfaces</code>
        <p>
          You should check the automatically generated interfaces
          file and make certain it only lists interfaces you are
          interested in. 
        </p>
        <p>
          By adding this file, you've just changed the config tree.
          Remember, you must compile the tree every time you edit
          it. Or rather, if you forget to compile the tree, the
          Cricket collector will do it for you, but in that case you
          are not likely to see any errors you might have
          introduced, so it's always a good idea to compile
          explicitly.
        </p>
        <p>
          Once again, run the collector by hand to make certain that
          it will be able to talk to your router and collect data.
          The command to do this is: 
        </p>
        <code class="block">% ~/cricket/collector /router-interfaces</code>
        <p>
          Once again, you should see that Cricket is successfully
          retrieving data for your targets. 
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Run the collector from cron. Now you need to set up cron
          to run the collector every five minutes for you. 
        </p>
        <p>
          The collector is usually run from a wrapper program whose
          job it is to handle locking, rotating log files, and other
          administivia. 
        </p>
        <p>
          The wrapper is called &ldquo;<code>collect-subtrees</code>&rdquo;.
          It reads a file from the Cricket install directory called
          &ldquo;<code>subtree-sets</code>&rdquo;. This file holds lists of
          subtrees which will get processed together in a group. It also lists
          the places where Cricket will expect to find it's configuration and
          log directory. As it comes in the distribution, this file needs no
          changes. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Later, you will find that this file lets you control what
          parts of your config tree will be collected in parallel.
          This is a critical feature to increase the number of
          devices you can poll. 
        </p>
        <p>
          You'll need to add an entry like this to cron:
        </p>
        <code class="block">
0,5,10,15,20,25,30,35,40,45,50,55 * * * * $HOME/cricket/collect-subtrees normal
        </code>
        <p>
          Or, if you are running Vixie Cron (an enhanced version of the cron
          utility that is common on Linux systems):
        </p>
        <code class="block">
*/5 * * * * $HOME/cricket/collect-subtrees normal
        </code>
        <p>
          If the script generates output, it will be sent to the user who owns
          the crontab. You should make certain you can see that mail. If you
          don't see the mail, you won't know what's wrong (though most of the
          messages you are likely to see will also show up in the
          &ldquo;<code>$HOME/cricket-logs</code>&rdquo; directory).

          Set up the Grapher. For this part of the installation, you will need
          an installation of Apache running which is correctly configured to
          let you run CGI scripts linked into your
          &ldquo;<code>$HOME/public_html</code>&rdquo; directory via a
          symlink. Configuring the web server correctly has proven to be the
          hardest for beginning Cricket users. Here are some resources that
          might help you get it right:

          OK, now that you have Apache (or some other web server)
          correctly installed, you need to make some more links. 
        </p>
        <code class="block">
  % cd $HOME/public_html
  % mkdir cricket
  % cd cricket
  % ln -s $HOME/cricket/VERSION .
  % ln -s $HOME/cricket/grapher.cgi .
  % ln -s $HOME/cricket/mini-graph.cgi .
  % ln -s $HOME/cricket/lib .
  % ln -s $HOME/cricket/images .
        </code>
        <p>
          These links expose the minimal amount of Cricket necessary
          to the web server. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, try going to this URL: 
          &ldquo;<code><a href="http://localhost/~cricket/cricket/grapher.cgi">http://localhost/~cricket/cricket/grapher.cgi</a></code>&rdquo;
        </p>
        <p>
          If you are running under a different user, or your webserver is on a
          different machine from your web browser, alter the URL accordingly.
          Additionally, if you want to get rid of the username reference in
          the URL (i.e., the &ldquo;<code>~cricket</code>&rdquo; bit), using
          another method to start &ldquo;<code>grapher.cgi</code>&rdquo;,
          you'll have to edit &ldquo;<code>grapher.cgi</code>&rdquo; and
          uncomment the lines&hellip;
        </p>
        <code class="block">
# $ENV{'HOME'} = '<var>/path/to/cricket/home</var>';
# return;
        </code>
        <p>
          &hellip;and replace &ldquo;<code>/path/to/cricket/home</code>&rdquo;
          with the directory you actually installed Cricket in. 
        </p>
        <p>
          You should see the front page, including some graphics and
          a couple of links to more stuff. If you get a web server
          error page instead you <strong>must</strong> go check the web server error
          log. The answer to what went wrong will almost certainly
          be in there.

          You're done! The graphs will not show any data for a while, since it
          takes some time to have enough history to make an interesting graph.
          As long as you are certain the collector is working right (now would
          be a very good time to check your e-mail for errors, and scan the
          files in &ldquo;<code>$HOME/cricket-logs</code>&rdquo; for errors)
          then you can take some time to read the other documentation, or
          maybe even grab a beer. 
        </p>
        <p>
          After about an hour, you should have some mildly interesting graphs.
          After a day, hopefully you'll have some very interesting graphs.
          After three months, you'll finally have graphs that you can show to
          your boss to prove that you need to upgrade the office's 384 kilobit
          DSL to a T3. We're pulling for you, really we are.

          The Next Step. Now that you are an expert (expert beginner, that
          is), you should add some more targets to your config tree, and
          explore the other subtrees in the sample-config tree. With those
          subtrees, you can monitor web server performance, switch port usage,
          and other interesting stuff. 
        </p>
        <p>
          As you learn more, you'll be able to make your own subtrees to
          handle special kinds of data unique to your site. If you make a
          subtree that can support a device others are using, please submit to
          the Cricket contributed configurations site, which is part of
          Cricket's homepage at &ldquo;<code><a
            href="http://cricket.sf.net/">http://cricket.sf.net/</a></code>&rdquo;.
