    <h1>Understanding and Using Monitor Thresholds</h1>
    <p>
      Although designed as a real-time data collection and trending
      tool, real-time alerts (or alarms) are a natural extended
      functionality for Cricket. Unfortunately, because they are not a
      part of the core design, the alert mechanisms in Cricket are not
      as cleanly implemented or efficient as they could be. If your
      interest is purely in a tool to generate real-time alerts, then
      Cricket is probably not the best choice. But if you already
      utilize Cricket for data collection and real-time trend analysis
      and you have the additional need for some light real-time
      alerting mechanism, then Cricket can meet your needs.
    </p>
    <p>
      In Cricket, the alert mechanism is called a <dfn>Monitor
      Threshold</dfn>. Monitor thresholds are set (or enabled) for specific
      data sources through the &ldquo;<code>monitor-thresholds</code>&rdquo;
      target dictionary tag. After the data collection pass, Cricket processes
      each monitor threshold by retrieving the most recent value of a data
      source from the RRD file and applying some criteria specific to the
      monitor threshold type. This criteria generates either a pass or fail
      condition. Depending on the setting of the persistent-alarms tag for the
      target, Cricket executes a specified action.
    </p>
    <p>
      Note that the most recent value of a data source from the RRD file will
      not necessarily agree with the most recent value fetched from by the
      collector because RRDtool interpolates. For those familiar with RRD tool
      internals, the &ldquo;most recent value&rdquo; is retreived from the
      first RRA in the file with a consolidation function of
      &ldquo;<code>AVERAGE</code>&rdquo;. The order of RRAs in the file is
      specified by the &ldquo;<code>rra</code>&rdquo; tag in the targetType
      dictionary.
    </p>
    <p>
      Note that a monitor threshold configured for a multi-instance
      (aka vector instances) target will be checked and an action
      possibly executed for each instance. Monitor thresholds are not
      supported for multi-targets (as multi-targets are purely a
      construct of the Cricket grapher).

          <p>
            The first target, &ldquo;<code>network-link-1</code>&rdquo;,
            has three monitor thresholds.
          </p>
          <ul>
          <li> 
            The first generates an SNMP trap whenever the utilized bandwidth,
            &ldquo;<code>ifInOctets</code>&rdquo;, exceeds 2Mbps (2.000.000
            bits / 8 = 250.000 octets). It is important to note that all
            entries defined in the &ldquo;<code>--default--</code>&rdquo;
            section will be inhereted by each target. In this case,
            &ldquo;<code>persistent-alarms = true</code>&rdquo;, has a direct
            impact when the action will be executed.
          </li>
          <li>
            The second generates an SNMP trap whenever the utilized bandwidth,
            ifInOctets, exceeds 80% of it's maximum capacity,
            %rrd-max-octets%. %rrd-max-octets% is a cricket variable that is
            replaced at runtime with it's real value. 
          </li>
          <li> 
            The third monitor threshold, checks to see if the current
            bandwidth, &ldquo;<code>ifInOctets</code>&rdquo;, has a value that
            is within 10% of the value recorded for the last interval (300
            seconds ago; assuming an
            &ldquo;<code>rrd-poll-interval</code>&rdquo; of 300 seconds). It
            computes
            &ldquo;<code>abs(ifInOctets_now - ifInOctets_then) / ifInOctets</code>&rdquo;
            and compares this with 10% (0.1). If traffic levels have increased
            more than 10% over the interval, it invokes &ldquo;<code>mailx</code>&rdquo;
            to send a mail message to &ldquo;<code>me@mydomain.com</code>&rdquo;
            (note the escaped backslash and escaped &ldquo;<code>@</code>&rdquo;).
            This action will also be executed everytime the threshold is
            crossed due to the inherited
            &ldquo;<code>persistent-alarms</code>&rdquo;.
          </li>
          <li> 
            The fourth monitor threshold checks to see if input errors,
            &ldquo;<code>ifInErrors</code>&rdquo;, exceed 0.1% of input
            packets, &ldquo;<code>ifInUcastPackets</code>&rdquo;. If
            errors exceed this threshold, Cricket generates an SNMP trap.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <code class="block">
target pop-2
  persistent-alarms  = false
  monitor-thresholds = 
    "users : hunt : 40 : pop-1 : users : FILE : /var/log/cricket-alerts"
        </code>
        <p>
          The second target, &ldquo;<code>pop-2</code>&rdquo;, has a single
          monitor threshold.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li> 
            Cricket will append an entry to the file
            &ldquo;<code>/var/log/cricket-alerts</code>&rdquo; when a non-zero
            number of users, &ldquo;<code>popUsers</code>&rdquo;, are on
            &ldquo;<code>pop-2</code>&rdquo; yet &ldquo;<code>pop-1</code>&rdquo;
            has not reached 40 users. Once &ldquo;<code>pop-1</code>&rdquo;
            reaches 40 users, or &ldquo;<code>pop-2</code>&rdquo; returns to a
            zero user count, the entry will be cleared from
            the file. A target can always redefine a variable that was set in
            the &ldquo;<code>--default--</code>&rdquo; section or inherited
            from lower in the config tree. In this case
            &ldquo;<code>persistent-alarms</code>&rdquo; are reset to the
            default value of &ldquo;<code>false</code>&rdquo;. Hence, the
            &ldquo;<code>FILE</code>&rdquo; action will be executed to set the
            alarm when the alarm condition is first detected and once to clear
            the alarm when the alarm condition is cleared.

         <p>

        <ul>
          <li> 
            The first two make use of the value monitor type to establish
            thresholds on cpu usage. More than one identical monitor type can
            be applied against the same datasource. In both cases, the
            &ldquo;<code>META</code>&rdquo; action is called with different
            arguments.

          <li>
            In the second value monitor, the keyword
            &ldquo;<code>SPAN</code>&rdquo; indicates there is an additional
            condition where the monitor threshold will only trigger an alarm
            when three consecutive monitor threshold tests fail. At the first
            threshold test pass, the alarm will be cleared.
          </li>
          <li> 
            The last monitor type will calculate
            &ldquo;<code>mem5minUsed</code>&rdquo; datasource divided by the
            &ldquo;<code>processorRAM</code>&rdquo; datasource and if the
            percentage is greater than 60% it will trigger a
            &ldquo;<code>META</code>&rdquo; action. Note that no additional
            arguments have been added to the &ldquo;<code>META</code>&rdquo;
            action, this is by design, read the Actions section for details on

      <h2>Persistent Alarms</h2>
      <p>
        By default, the target tag
        &ldquo;<code>persistent-alarms</code>&rdquo; is set to false. With
        this setting, the first time a monitor threshold criteria fails, the
        action is executed. Specifically, the
        &ldquo;<code>Alarm()</code>&rdquo; subroutine in the
        &ldquo;<code>Monitor.pm</code>&rdquo; module is invoked; the action
        and its arguments are passed as arguments. If the criteria continues
        to fail (at subsequent data collection passes), the action is not
        executed again. After one or more failures, the first time the monitor
        threshold criteria passes, the action is executed. In this case, the
        &ldquo;<code>Clear()</code>&rdquo; subroutine in the
        &ldquo;<code>Monitor.pm</code>&rdquo; module is invoked, with
        appropriate action and action arguments. Thus the default behavior is
        like a switch that toggles states when the result of the monitor
        threshold criteria changes.
      </p>
      <p>
        If the target tag &ldquo;<code>persistent-alarms</code>&rdquo; is
        true, the action is executed (the &ldquo;<code>Alarm()</code>&rdquo;
        subroutine is invoked) every time the monitor threshold criteria
        fails. An action (and &ldquo;<code>Clear()</code>&rdquo; subroutine)
        is still executed once the first time the criteria passes after a
        string of failures. With &ldquo;<code>persistent-alarms</code>&rdquo;
        set to true, monitor threshold behavior is like a bell. It keeps
        ringing until the problem stops.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div>
      <h2>Monitor Types</h2>
      <p>
        The monitor type determines the criteria used to check a
        monitor threshold.
      </p>
      <div>
        <h3>&ldquo;<code>exact</code>&rdquo;</h3>
        <p>
          These monitors are the simplest to use and configure, and allow you
          to monitor a datasource for an exact match. This is useful in cases
          where an enumerated (or boolean) SNMP object instruments a condition
          where a transition to a specific state requires attention. For
          example, a datasource might return either true <!--(1)--> or
          false <!--(2)-->,
          depending on whether or not a power supply has failed. The exact
          monitor expects one argument; the value on which the monitor will
          trigger. For example,
          &ldquo;<code>monitor-thresholds = "dsPowerFail:exact:1"</code>&rdquo;
          would cause Cricket to send a trap when
          the last value of the &ldquo;<code>dsPowerFail</code>&rdquo;
          datasource in the RRD file for
          this target is &ldquo;<code>1</code>&rdquo;.
        </p>
        <code class="block">
dsPowerFail : exact : 1 : &lt;ACTION&gt; : [&hellip;]
dsTempAlarm : exact : 1 : &lt;ACTION&gt; : [&hellip;]
        </code>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h3>&ldquo;<code>value</code>&rdquo;</h3>
        <p>
          The next simplest monitor type, value monitor thresholds take two
          arguments, a minimum and maximum value. If the data source strays
          outside of this interval, the monitor threshold criteria fails. To
          omit the minimum or maximum value, use the character
          &ldquo;<code>n</code>&rdquo;.
        </p>
        <code class="block">
temperature : value : 30 :     90 : &lt;ACTION&gt; : [&hellip;]
 ifInOctets : value :  n : 250000 : &lt;ACTION&gt; : [&hellip;]
        </code>
      </div>

      <div>
        <h3>&ldquo;<code>relation</code>&rdquo;</h3>
        <p>
          Relation monitor thresholds are very flexible. A relation monitor
          considers the difference between two data sources (possibly from
          different targets), or alternatively, the difference between two
          temporally distinct values for the same data source. The first data
          source is the data source for which the relation monitor threshold
          is defined. The difference can be expressed as absolute value, or as
          a percentage of the second data source (comparison) value. This
          difference is compared to a threshold argument with either the
          greater than or less than operator. The criteria fails when the
          expression &ldquo;<code class="inline">&lt;absolute or relative
          difference> &lt;either greater-than or less-than>
          &lt;threshold></code>&rdquo; evaluates to false. The
          four colon-delimited arguments for a relation monitor are:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            The threshold number, optionally preceded by the greater than
            (&ldquo;<code>&gt;</code>&rdquo;) or less than
            (&ldquo;<code>&lt;</code>&rdquo;) symbol, and optionally followed
            by the string &ldquo;<code>pct</code>&rdquo;. If omitted, greater
            than is used by default and the expression
            &ldquo;<code>difference > threshold</code>&rdquo; is evaluated.
            &ldquo;<code>&lt;10 pct</code>&rdquo;,
            &ldquo;<code>>1000</code>&rdquo;, &ldquo;<code>50 pct</code>&rdquo;,
            &ldquo;<code>></code>&rdquo; and &ldquo;<code>500</code>&rdquo;
            are all examples of valid thresholds.
          </li>
          <li>
            The name of the comparison target. The comparison target must
            either share the same path with the first target or be
            fully-qualified. This argument is optional and if omitted the
            first target is also taken as the comparison target.
          </li>
          <li>
            The name of the comparison data source, variable, integer or
            floating point value. In the case of a  data source must
            belong to the comparison target. This argument is optional and if
            omitted the monitor threshold data source name is also taken as
            the comparison data source name. Integer and floating point
            values can be signed or unsigned.
            e.g. <code class="inline">-1.05, 5, 10.1, +5</code>.
          </li>
          <li>
            The temporal offset in seconds to go back in the RRD file that is
            being fetched from for comparison. Note that a data source value
            must exist in the RRD file for that exact offset. Choose a
            multiple of the RRD file step size. This argument is optional and
            if omitted, it is set to &ldquo;<code>0</code>&rdquo;.
          </li>
        </ol>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h3>&ldquo;<code>quotient</code>&rdquo;</h3>
        <p>
          Quotient monitor thresholds are similar to relation monitor
          thresholds, except that they consider the quotient of two data
          sources, or alternatively, the same data source at two different
          time points. For a quotient monitor threshold, Cricket computes the
          value of the first data source as a percentage of the value second
          data source (such that 10 is 50% of 20). This percentage is then
          compared to a threshold argument with either the greater than or
          less than operator. The criteria fails when the expression
          &ldquo;<code class="inline">&lt;percentage&gt; &lt;either
          greater-than or less-than&gt; &lt;threshold&gt;</code>&rdquo;
          evaluates to true. The four colon-delimited
          arguments for a quotient monitor are:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            The threshold number, optionally preceded by the greater than
            (&ldquo;<code>&gt;</code>&rdquo;) or less than
            (&ldquo;<code>&lt;</code>&rdquo;) symbol followed by the string
            &ldquo;<code>pct</code>&rdquo;. If omitted, greater than is used
            by default and the expression &ldquo;<code
              class="inline">difference > threshold</code>&rdquo; is evaluated.
          </li>
          <li>
            The name of the comparison target. The comparison target must
            either share the same path with the first target or be
            fully-qualified. This argument is optional and if omitted the
            first target is also taken as the comparison target.
          </li>
          <li>
            The name of the comparison data source variable, integer or
            floating point value. This data source must belong to the
            comparison target. This argument is optional and if omitted the
            monitor threshold data source name is also taken as the
            comparison data source name.
            e.g. <code class="inline">-1.05, 5, 10.1, +5</code>.
          </li>
          <li>
            The temporal offset in seconds to go back in the RRD file that is
            being fetched from for comparison. Note that a data source value
            must exist in the RRD file for that exact offset. Choose a
            multiple of the RRD file step size. This argument is optional and
            if omitted, it is set to &ldquo;<code>0</code>&rdquo;.
          </li>
        </ol>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h3>&ldquo;<code>hunt</code>&rdquo;</h3>
        <p>
          The hunt monitor threshold is designed for the situation where the
          data source serves as an overflow for another data source; that is,
          if one data source (the parent) is at or near capacity, then traffic
          will begin to appear on this (the monitored) data source. One
          application of hunt monitor thresholds is to identify premature
          rollover in a set of modem banks configured to hunt from one to the
          next. Specifically, the criteria of the hunt monitor threshold
          fails if the value of the monitored data source is non-zero and the
          current value of the parent data source falls below a specified
          capacity threshold. The three colon-delimited arguments for a hunt
          monitor are:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            The threshold of the parent data source. Generally this should be
            slightly less than the maximum capacity of the target.
          </li>
          <li>
            The name of the parent target. The parent target must either share
            the same path with the monitored target or be fully-qualified.
            This argument is optional and if omitted the monitored target is
            also taken as the parent target.
          </li>
          <li>
            The name of the parent data source. This data source must belong
            to the parent target. This argument is optional and if omitted the
            monitor threshold data source name is also take as the comparison
            data source name.
          </li>
        </ol>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h3>&ldquo;<code>failures</code>&rdquo;</h3>
        <p>
          The failures monitor threshold is integrated with aberrant behavior
          detection in RRDtool. This monitor checks the
          &ldquo;<code>FAILURES</code>&rdquo; RRA for the target and
          datasource. If the current value is &ldquo;<code>1</code>&rdquo;,
          this indicates aberrant behavior. Aberrant behavior detection must
          be enabled for the target, which requires RRDtool 1.1.x. This
          threshold may be conditioned on the current value of the datasource.
          In this case, the threshold is only triggered when both the
          &ldquo;<code>FAILURES</code>&rdquo; RRA is
          &ldquo;<code>1</code>&rdquo; and the current value of the data
          source is within a specified range. This range is specified via two
          colon-delimited arguments; the first is the min or
          &ldquo;<code>n</code>&rdquo; to specify no lower bound and the
          second is the max or &ldquo;<code>n</code>&rdquo; to specify no
          upper bound.

      <h2>Alarm Actions</h2>
      <p>
        After the monitor threshold is checked for the current
        value, Cricket may execute one of several actions.&nbsp;
        Each action requires one or more arguments, which appear
        as a colon-delimited list following the action tag in
        the monitor threshold specification.
      </p>
      <p>
        SNMP: Generating a SNMP trap is the default action if
        the action tag is omitted from a monitor threshold
        specification. To support this default and for backwards
        compatibility, the action SNMP does not use the action
        arguments field in the monitor threshold specification.
        The SNMP action instead requires the attribute
        trap-address to be set for target. The traps Cricket
        sends are marked with the enterprise OID
        ".1.3.6.1.4.1.2595.1.1".&nbsp; The generic type is 6 and
        specific type is 4 for failure (violation) of the
        monitor threshold criteria and 5 for success (recall the
        trap is cleared on the first success after one or more
        failures).&nbsp; There are currently nine varbinds: the
        monitor type,&nbsp; the monitor threshold string, the
        target name, data source name, cricket user name (set to
        "cricket" on Win32 platforms), instance number (to
        distinguish targets with multiple instances), instance name,
        contact name (based on the html dictionary entry contact-name),
        and data value. These
        varbinds are set (and could be customized) in the
        sendMonitorTrap() subroutine in Monitor.pm.
      </p>
      <p>
        MAIL: This action sends email to a specified address via
        a Berkeley mailx compatible mail program. The first
        action argument is the program to invoke to send email.
        It is assumed that this program is compatible with
        Berkeley mailx. That is, the program accepts piped input
        as the message body, and supports a "-s" command flag to
        specify the subject.&nbsp; If you don't have such a
        program on your system, you may wish to customize the
        code in the sendEmail() subroutine in Monitor.pm to
        utilize your email program. The second action argument
        is the recipient's email address. Note that as in the
        example, you may need to escape special characters. Both
        arguments are required. The mail message body includes
        the following information: the monitor type, the monitor
        threshold string, the target name, data source name, the
        value of the data source retrieved from the RRD file,
        and the instance number (to distinguish targets with
        multiple instances). To change the contents of the
        message, customize the sendEmail() subroutine in
        Monitor.pm.
      </p>
      <p>
        FILE: This action appends and deletes entries (lines)
        from a file. When the monitor threshold criteria first
        fails, a line containing details in a space-delimited
        format is appended to the file specified as the action
        argument (the FILE action has only one argument).
        Subsequent failures do not add multiple lines to the
        file. The FILE action essentially ignores
        persistent-alarms = true (though some overhead is
        incurred to detect duplicate lines, so persistent-alarms
        should be set to false when possible for targets using
        the FILE action). When the monitor threshold passes
        again after one or more failures, the line is deleted
        from the file.&nbsp; The line details include the target
        name and the data source name. To include other details,
        customize the LogToFile() subroutine in Monitor.pm.
      </p>
      <p>
        EXEC: This action executes a shell command or script.
        The first action argument is the shell command or script
        to execute when the monitor threshold criteria fails.
        The second action argument is the shell command or
        script to execute when the monitor threshold passes
        again after one or more failures. The EXEC action
        provides a mechanism by which automated corrective
        action can be taken.
      </p>
      <p>
        FUNC: This action is similar to EXEC, except that a perl
        subroutine defined in the Cricket scope is executed. The
        first action argument is the function invoked when the
        monitor threshold criteria fails. The second action
        argument is the function invoked when the monitor
        threshold passes again after one or more failures.&nbsp;
        To use this action, you must first modify the entry in
        the func.pm module to set the global variable
        gMonFuncEnabled. Using this action requires
        customization (you must write the subroutines). While
        this mechanism provides complete flexibility in handling
        special cases, the invoked subroutines cannot easily
        accept arguments (this can be done, but the argument
        list must be included by name in the action arguments
        which can quickly become unwieldy). If your function
        requires access to arguments available in the Alarm()
        and Clear() functions, you might consider adding a new
        action tag (and sharing your work with the Cricket
        community).
      </p>
      
  <p> META: This action is meant to be used to shared threshold monitoring event 
    data with other external systems. This action does nothing. In the sense, 
    that no external action is initiated. There is no mail sent, no SNMP trap 
    generated or any other specific action. What it does is let cricket know the 
    fact that an alarm has been generated or cleared. Cricket stores all active 
    alarms in an internal format call meta files. These files are stored in the 
    cricket-data directory along side each target.rrd file that has monitor-thresholds 
    defined for it. The meta files store alarm data for all Action types.The monitor-threshold 
    line itself and other data is stored in the meta file. Arguments are arbitrary.</p>
  <p>Using this action requires customization (you must write the external interface 
    script). The most common uses for this are for sharing event data with event 
    management systems such as NetCool, BigBrother and others. Event management 
    systems often support SNMP, proprietary agents or APIs. This permits a flexible 
    way of interacting with these systems with something other than an SNMP trap.</p>
  <p>To provide this, your external script must load the config-tree in memory, 
    query it for active alarms and configured monitoring thresholds and send messages 
    in the appropriate format to the event manager. An example script is provided 
    in the util directory of the Cricket distribution, metaQuery.pl. Note that 
    this is not to be mistaken with real time monitoring, as you have to wait 
    for the collector run to be finished before querying the config-tree or else 
    risk missing a new alarm until the next query.</p>

    <h2>Monitoring Span</h2>
    <p> Cricket monitoring thresholds can be extended to look for consecutive 
      threshold failures. The SPAN keyword will require a threshold to be crossed 
      an arbitrary number of consecutive times before triggering an alarm. The 
      keyword SPAN and a span-length value are required to enable this action. 
      At the first threshold verification that passes, the alarm will be cleared. 
      Threshold crosses that have not been promoted to alarms are stored in the 
      meta file associated with the monitored target. Using the following meta 
      file format:</p>
    <p>&lt;monitor-threshold&gt; &lt;timestamp-of-first-failure&gt; failure lastval 
      &lt;ds-value-at-time-of-first-failure&gt;</p>
    <p>When the time stamp of a threshold cross is older than &lt;span-length&gt; 
      * %rrd-poll-interval%, an alarm is generated. This option is fully compatible 
      with the persistent-alarms option.</p>
