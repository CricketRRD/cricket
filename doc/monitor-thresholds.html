    <h1>Understanding and Utilizing Cricket Monitor Thresholds</h1>
    <p>
      Although designed as a real-time data collection and trending
      tool, real-time alerts (or alarms) are a natural extended
      functionality for Cricket. Unfortunately, because they are not a
      part of the core design, the alert mechanisms in Cricket are not
      as cleanly implemented or efficient as they could be. If your
      interest is purely in a tool to generate real-time alerts, then
      Cricket is probably not the best choice. But if you already
      utilize Cricket for data collection and real-time trend analysis
      and you have the additional need for some light real-time
      alerting mechanism, then Cricket can meet your needs.
    </p>
    <p>
      In Cricket, the alert mechanism is called a monitor threshold.
      Monitor thresholds are set (or enabled) for specific data
      sources through the monitor-thresholds target dictionary tag.
      After the data collection pass, Cricket processes each monitor
      threshold by retrieving the most recent value of a data source
      from the RRD file and applying some criteria specific to the
      monitor threshold type. This criteria generates either a pass or
      fail condition. Depending on the setting of the
      persistent-alarms tag for the target, Cricket executes a
      specified action.
    </p>
    <p>
      Note that the most recent value of a data source from the RRD
      file will not necessarily agree with the most recent value
      fetched from by the collector because RRDtool
      interpolates.&nbsp; For those familiar with RRD tool internals,
      the "most recent value" is retreived from the first RRA in the
      file with a consolidation function of AVERAGE. The order of RRAs
      in the file is specified by the rra tag in the targetType
      dictionary.
    </p>
    <p>
      Note that a monitor threshold configured for a multi-instance
      (aka vector instances) target will be checked and an action
      possibly executed for each instance. Monitor thresholds are not
      supported for multi-targets (as multi-targets are purely a
      construct of the Cricket grapher).

  <h2>Explaining the Examples </h2>
  <pre>target network-link-1
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; monitor-thresholds =
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "ifInOctets : value : n : 250000 : SNMP,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ifInOctets : quotient : >80pct : : %rrd-max-octets% : SNMP,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ifInOctets : relation : &lt;10 pct : : : 300 : MAIL :&nbsp; %mail-pgm% : me\\\@mydomain.com,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ifInErrors : quotient : 0.1 pct : : ifInUcastPackets : SNMP"</pre>
  <p> The first target, <i>network-link-1</i>, has three monitor thresholds.</p>
</div>
<ul>
  <li> 
    <div>The first generates an SNMP trap whenever the utilized bandwidth, ifInOctets, 
      exceeds 2 Mbps (2000000bits /8 = 250000 octets). It is important to note 
      that all entries defined in the --default-- section will be inhereted by 
      each target. In this case, persistent-alarms = true, has a direct impact 
      when the action will be executed.</div>
  </li>
  <li> 
    <div>The second generates an SNMP trap whenever the utilized bandwidth, ifInOctets, 
      exceeds 80% of it's maximum capacity, %rrd-max-octets%. %rrd-max-octets% is
      a cricket variable that is replaced at runtime with it's real value. 
      </div>
  </li>
  <li> 
    <div>The third monitor threshold, checks to see if the current bandwidth, 
      ifInOctets, has a value that is within 10% of the value recorded for the 
      last interval (300 seconds ago; assuming an rrd-poll-interval of 300 seconds). 
      It computes abs(ifInOctets_now - ifInOctets_then)/ifInOctets then and compares 
      this with 10% (0.1). If traffic levels have increased more than 10% over 
      the interval, it invokes mailx to send a mail message to me@mydomain.com 
      (note the escaped backslash and escaped '@'). This action will also be executed 
      everytime the threshold is crossed due to the inherited persistent-alarms.</div>
  </li>
  <li> 
    <div>The fourth monitor threshold checks to see if input errors, ifInErrors, 
      exceed 0.1% of input packets, ifInUcastPackets. If errors exceed this threshold, 
      Cricket generates an SNMP trap. </div>
  </li>
</ul>
<div> 
  <pre>
target pop-2
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; persistent-alarms = false
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; monitor-thresholds = 
     "users : hunt : 40 : pop-1 : users : FILE : /var/log/cricket-alerts"
   </pre>
  <p> The second target, <i>pop-2</i>, has a single monitor threshold. </p>
</div>
<ul>
  <li> 
    <div>Cricket will append an entry to the file /var/log/cricket-alerts when 
      a non-zero number of users, popUsers, are on pop-2 yet pop-1 has not reached 
      40 users. Once pop-1 reaches 40 users, or&nbsp; pop-2 returns to a zero 
      user count, the entry will be cleared from the file. A target can always 
      redefine a variable that was set in the --default-- section or inhereted 
      from lower in the config tree. In this case persistent-alarms are reset 
      to the default value of false. Hence, the FILE action will be executed to 
      set the alarm when the alarm condition is first detected and once to clear 
      the alarm when the alarm condition is cleared.</div>
  </li>
</ul>
<div> 
  <pre>
target router-chassis
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; persistent-alarms = false
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; monitor-thresholds = 
    "cpu1min : value : n : 60 : META : router-cpu : yellow,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; cpu1min : value : n : 90 : META : router-cpu : red : SPAN : 3,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; mem5minUsed : quotient : &gt;60pct : : processorRam: META"
   </pre>
  <p> The third target, <i>router-chassis</i>, has a three monitor thresholds. 
  </p>
</div>
<ul>
  <li> 
    <div>The first two make use of the value monitor type to establish thresholds 
      on cpu usage. More than one identical monitor type can be applied against 
      the same datasource. In both cases, the META action is called with different 
      arguments.</div>
  </li>
  <li>In the second value monitor, the keyword SPAN indicates there is an additional 
    condition where the monitor threshold will only trigger an alarm when three 
    consecutive monitor threshold tests fail. At the first threshold test pass, 
    the alarm will be cleared. </li>
  <li> 
    <div>The last monitor type will calculate mem5minUsed datasource divided by 
      the processorRAM datasource and if the percentage is greater than 60% it 
      will trigger a META action. Note that no additional arguments have been 
      added to the META action, this is by design, read the Actions section for 
      details on how to use this and other actions. </div>
  </li>
</ul>
<div>
      <h2>Persistent Alarms</h2>
      <p>
        By default, the target tag persistent-alarms is set to
        false. With this setting, the first time a monitor threshold
        criteria fails, the action is executed.&nbsp; Specifically,
        the Alarm() subroutine in the Monitor.pm module is invoked;
        the action and its arguments are passed as arguments. If the
        criteria continues to fail (at subsequent data collection
        passes), the action is not executed again. After one or more
        failures, the first time the monitor threshold criteria
        passes, the action is executed. In this case, the Clear()
        subroutine in the Monitor.pm module is invoked, with
        appropriate action and action arguments.&nbsp; Thus the
        default behavior is like a switch that toggles states when
        the result of the monitor threshold criteria changes.
      </p>
      <p>
        If the target tag persistent-alarms is true, the action is
        executed (the Alarm subroutine is invoked) every time the
        monitor threshold criteria fails. An action (and Clear
        subroutine) is still executed once the first time the
        criteria passes after a string of failures. With
        persistent-alarms set to true, monitor threshold behavior is
        like a bell. It keeps ringing until the problem stops.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div>
      <h2>Monitor Types</h2>
      <p>
        The monitor type determines the criteria used to check a
        monitor threshold.
      </p>
      
  <p> exact : </p>
  <p>These monitors are the simplest to use and configure, and allow you to monitor 
    a datasource for an exact match. This is useful in cases where an enumerated 
    (or boolean) SNMP object instruments a condition where a transition to a specific 
    state requires attention. For example, a datasource might return either true(1) 
    or false(2), depending on whether or not a power supply has failed. The exact 
    monitor expects one argument; the value on which the monitor will trigger. 
    For example, <tt>monitor-thresholds = "dsPowerFail:exact:1"</tt> would cause 
    Cricket to send a trap when the last value of the "dsPowerFail" datasource 
    in the RRD file for this target is 1. </p>
  <pre>    dsPowerFail : exact : 1 : &lt;ACTION&gt; : ...
    dsTempAlarm : exact : 1 : &lt;ACTION&gt; : ...
  </pre>
      
  <p> value : </p>
  <p>The next simplest monitor type, value monitor thresholds take two arguments, 
    a minimum and maximum value. If the data source strays outside of this interval, 
    the monitor threshold criteria fails. To omit the minimum or maximum value, 
    use the character "n". </p>
  <pre>    temperature : value : 30 : 90 : &lt;ACTION&gt; : ...
    ifInOctets : value : n : 250000 : &lt;ACTION&gt; : ...
 </pre>
  <p>relation : </p>
  <p>Relation monitor thresholds are very flexible. A relation monitor considers 
    the difference between two data sources (possibly from different targets), 
    or alternatively, the difference between two temporally distinct values for 
    the same data source. The first data source is the data source for which the 
    relation monitor threshold is defined. The difference can be expressed as 
    absolute value, or as a percentage of the second data source (comparison) 
    value. This difference is compared to a threshold argument with either the 
    greater than or less than operator. The criteria fails when the expression 
    (&lt;absolute or relative difference> &lt;either greater-than or less-than> 
    &lt;threshold>) evaluates to false. The four colon-delimited arguments for 
    a relation monitor are: </p>
      
  <ol>
    <li> The threshold number, optionally preceded by the greater than (>) or 
      less than (&lt;) symbol, and optionally followed by the string "pct". If 
      omitted, greater than is used by default and the expression, difference 
      > threshold, is evaluated.&nbsp; "&lt;10 pct", ">1000", "50 pct", and "500" 
      are all examples of valid thresholds. </li>
    <li> The name of the comparison target. The comparison target must either 
      share the same path with the first target or be fully-qualified. This argument 
      is optional and if omitted the first target is also taken as the comparison 
      target. </li>
    <li> The name of the comparison data source, variable, integer or floating point value. 
      In the case of a data source it must belong to the comparison target. 
      This argument is optional and if omitted the monitor 
      threshold data source name is also taken as the comparison data source name. 
      Integer and floating point values can be signed or unsigned. 
      ie: -1.05, 5, 10.1, +5
    </li>
    <li> The temporal offset in seconds to go back in the RRD file that is being 
      fetched from for comparison. Note that a data source value must exist in 
      the RRD file for that exact offset. Choose a multiple of the RRD file step 
      size. This argument is optional and if omitted, it is set to 0. </li>
  </ol>
  <p>quotient : </p>
  <p>Quotient monitor thresholds are similar to relation monitor thresholds, except 
    that they consider the quotient of two data sources, or alternatively, the 
    same data source at two different time points. For a quotient monitor threshold, 
    Cricket computes the value of the first data source as a percentage of the 
    value second data source (such as 10 is 50% of 20). This percentage is then 
    compared to a threshold argument with either the greater than or less than 
    operator. The criteria fails when the expression (&lt;percentage> &lt;either 
    greater-than or less-than> &lt;threshold>) evaluates to true. The four colon-delimited 
    arguments for a quotient monitor are: </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          The threshold number, optionally preceded by the
          greater than (>) or less than (&lt;) symbol followed
          by the string&nbsp; "pct". If omitted, greater than
          is used by default and the expression, difference >
          threshold, is evaluated.
        </li>
        <li>
          The name of the comparison target. 
          The comparison target must either share the same path with the
          first target or be fully-qualified. This argument is
          optional and if omitted the first target is also
          taken as the comparison targete.
        </li>
        <li>
          The name of the comparison data source, variable, integer
          or floating point value.  This data source must belong
          to the comparison target. This argument is optional
          and if omitted the monitor threshold data source name
          is also taken as the comparison data source name. 
          ie: -1.05, 5, 10.1, +5
        </li>
        <li>
          The temporal offset in seconds to go back in the RRD
          file that is being fetched from for comparison. Note
          that a data source value must exist in the RRD file
          for that exact offset. Choose a multiple of the RRD
          file step size. This argument is optional and if
          omitted, it is set to 0.
        </li>
      </ol>
      
  <p> hunt: </p>
  <p>The hunt monitor threshold is designed for the situation where the data source 
    serves as an overflow for another data source; that is, if one data source 
    (the parent) is at or near capacity, then traffic will begin to appear on 
    this (the monitored) data source.&nbsp; One application of hunt monitor thresholds 
    is to identify premature rollover in a set of modem banks configured to hunt 
    from one to the next.&nbsp; Specifically, the criteria of the hunt monitor 
    threshold fails if the value of the monitored data source is non-zero and 
    the current value of the parent data source falls below a specified capacity 
    threshold. The three colon-delimited arguments for a hunt monitor are: </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          The threshold of the parent data source. Generally
          this should be slightly less than the maximum
          capacity of the target.
        </li>
        <li>
          The name of the parent target. The parent target
          must either share the same path with the monitored
          target or be fully-qualified. This argument is
          optional and if omitted the monitored target is also
          taken as the parent target.
        </li>
        <li>
          The name of the parent data source. This data source
          must belong to the parent target. This argument is
          optional and if omitted the monitor threshold data
          source name is also take as the comparison data
          source name.
        </li>
      </ol>
      
  <p> failures: </p>
  <p>The failures monitor threshold is integrated with aberrant behavior detection 
    in RRDtool. This monitor checks the FAILURES RRA for the target and datasource. 
    If the current value is 1, this indicates aberrant behavior. Aberrant behavior 
    detection must be enabled for the target, which requires RRDtool 1.1.x. This 
    threshold may be conditioned on the current value of the datasource. In this 
    case, the threshold is only triggered when both the FAILURES RRA is 1 and 
    the current value of the data source is within a specified range. This range 
    is specified via two colon-delimited arguments; the first is the min or "n" 
    to specify no lower bound and the second is the max or "n" to specify no upper 
    bound. </p>
    </div>

    <div>
      
  <h2>Alarm Actions</h2>
      <p>
        After the monitor threshold is checked for the current
        value, Cricket may execute one of several actions.&nbsp;
        Each action requires one or more arguments, which appear
        as a colon-delimited list following the action tag in
        the monitor threshold specification.
      </p>
      <p>
        SNMP: Generating a SNMP trap is the default action if
        the action tag is omitted from a monitor threshold
        specification. To support this default and for backwards
        compatibility, the action SNMP does not use the action
        arguments field in the monitor threshold specification.
        The SNMP action instead requires the attribute
        trap-address to be set for target. The traps Cricket
        sends are marked with the enterprise OID
        ".1.3.6.1.4.1.2595.1.1".&nbsp; The generic type is 6 and
        specific type is 4 for failure (violation) of the
        monitor threshold criteria and 5 for success (recall the
        trap is cleared on the first success after one or more
        failures).&nbsp; There are currently nine varbinds: the
        monitor type,&nbsp; the monitor threshold string, the
        target name, data source name, cricket user name (set to
        "cricket" on Win32 platforms), instance number (to
        distinguish targets with multiple instances), instance name,
        contact name (based on the html dictionary entry contact-name),
        and data value. These
        varbinds are set (and could be customized) in the
        sendMonitorTrap() subroutine in Monitor.pm.
      </p>
      <p>
        MAIL: This action sends email to a specified address via
        a Berkeley mailx compatible mail program. The first
        action argument is the program to invoke to send email.
        It is assumed that this program is compatible with
        Berkeley mailx. That is, the program accepts piped input
        as the message body, and supports a "-s" command flag to
        specify the subject.&nbsp; If you don't have such a
        program on your system, you may wish to customize the
        code in the sendEmail() subroutine in Monitor.pm to
        utilize your email program. The second action argument
        is the recipient's email address. Note that as in the
        example, you may need to escape special characters. Both
        arguments are required. The mail message body includes
        the following information: the monitor type, the monitor
        threshold string, the target name, data source name, the
        value of the data source retrieved from the RRD file,
        and the instance number (to distinguish targets with
        multiple instances). To change the contents of the
        message, customize the sendEmail() subroutine in
        Monitor.pm.
      </p>
      <p>
        FILE: This action appends and deletes entries (lines)
        from a file. When the monitor threshold criteria first
        fails, a line containing details in a space-delimited
        format is appended to the file specified as the action
        argument (the FILE action has only one argument).
        Subsequent failures do not add multiple lines to the
        file. The FILE action essentially ignores
        persistent-alarms = true (though some overhead is
        incurred to detect duplicate lines, so persistent-alarms
        should be set to false when possible for targets using
        the FILE action). When the monitor threshold passes
        again after one or more failures, the line is deleted
        from the file.&nbsp; The line details include the target
        name and the data source name. To include other details,
        customize the LogToFile() subroutine in Monitor.pm.
      </p>
      <p>
        EXEC: This action executes a shell command or script.
        The first action argument is the shell command or script
        to execute when the monitor threshold criteria fails.
        The second action argument is the shell command or
        script to execute when the monitor threshold passes
        again after one or more failures. The EXEC action
        provides a mechanism by which automated corrective
        action can be taken.

        FUNC: This action is similar to EXEC, except that a perl
        subroutine defined in the Cricket scope is executed. The
        first action argument is the function invoked when the
        monitor threshold criteria fails. The second action
        argument is the function invoked when the monitor
        threshold passes again after one or more failures.&nbsp;
        To use this action, you must first modify the entry in
        the func.pm module to set the global variable
        gMonFuncEnabled. Using this action requires
        customization (you must write the subroutines). While
        this mechanism provides complete flexibility in handling
        special cases, the invoked subroutines cannot easily
        accept arguments (this can be done, but the argument
        list must be included by name in the action arguments
        which can quickly become unwieldy). If your function
        requires access to arguments available in the Alarm()
        and Clear() functions, you might consider adding a new
        action tag (and sharing your work with the Cricket
        community).

  <p> META: This action is meant to be used to shared threshold monitoring event 
    data with other external systems. This action does nothing. In the sense, 
    that no external action is initiated. There is no mail sent, no SNMP trap 
    generated or any other specific action. What it does is let cricket know the 
    fact that an alarm has been generated or cleared. Cricket stores all active 
    alarms in an internal format call meta files. These files are stored in the 
    cricket-data directory along side each target.rrd file that has monitor-thresholds 
    defined for it. The meta files store alarm data for all Action types.The monitor-threshold 
    line itself and other data is stored in the meta file. Arguments are arbitrary.</p>
  <p>Using this action requires customization (you must write the external interface 
    script). The most common uses for this are for sharing event data with event 
    management systems such as NetCool, BigBrother and others. Event management 
    systems often support SNMP, proprietary agents or APIs. This permits a flexible 
    way of interacting with these systems with something other than an SNMP trap.</p>
  <p>To provide this, your external script must load the config-tree in memory, 
    query it for active alarms and configured monitoring thresholds and send messages 
    in the appropriate format to the event manager. An example script is provided 
    in the util directory of the Cricket distribution, metaQuery.pl. Note that 
    this is not to be mistaken with real time monitoring, as you have to wait 
    for the collector run to be finished before querying the config-tree or else 
    risk missing a new alarm until the next query.</p>

    <h2>Monitoring Span</h2>
    <p> Cricket monitoring thresholds can be extended to look for consecutive 
      threshold failures. The SPAN keyword will require a threshold to be crossed 
      an arbitrary number of consecutive times before triggering an alarm. The 
      keyword SPAN and a span-length value are required to enable this action. 
      At the first threshold verification that passes, the alarm will be cleared. 
      Threshold crosses that have not been promoted to alarms are stored in the 
      meta file associated with the monitored target. Using the following meta 
      file format:</p>
    <p>&lt;monitor-threshold&gt; &lt;timestamp-of-first-failure&gt; failure lastval 
      &lt;ds-value-at-time-of-first-failure&gt;</p>
    <p>When the time stamp of a threshold cross is older than &lt;span-length&gt; 
      * %rrd-poll-interval%, an alarm is generated. This option is fully compatible 
      with the persistent-alarms option.</p>
