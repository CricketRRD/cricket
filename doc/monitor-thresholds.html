<b>Understanding and Utilizing Cricket Monitor Thresholds</b>
<p>Draft 2: 6/22/2001
<p>The information in this document is current as of the Cricket 1.0.3
release.
<p>Although designed as a real-time data collection and trending tool,
real-time alerts (or alarms) are a natural extended functionality for Cricket.
Unfortunately, because they are not a part of the core design, the alert
mechanisms in Cricket are not as cleanly implemented or efficient as they
could be. If your interest is purely in a tool to generate real-time alerts,
then Cricket is probably not the best choice. But if you already utilize
Cricket for data collection and real-time trend analysis and you have the
additional need for some light real-time alerting mechanism, then Cricket
can meet your needs.
<p>In Cricket, the alert mechanism is called a monitor threshold. Monitor
thresholds are set (or enabled) for specific data sources through the monitor-thresholds
target dictionary tag. After the data collection pass, Cricket processes
each monitor threshold by retrieving the most recent value of a data source
from the RRD file and applying some criteria specific to the monitor threshold
type. This criteria generates either a pass or fail condition. Depending
on the setting of the persistent-alarms tag for the target, Cricket executes
a specified action.
<p>Note that the most recent value of a data source from the RRD file will
not necessarily agree with the most recent value fetched from by the collector
because RRDtool interpolates.&nbsp; For those familiar with RRD tool internals,
the "most recent value" is retreived from the first RRA in the file with
a consolidation function of AVERAGE. The order of RRAs in the file is specified
by the rra tag in the targetType dictionary.
<p>Note that a monitor threshold configured for a multi-instance (aka vector
instances) target will be checked and an action possibly executed for each
instance. Monitor thresholds are not supported for multi-targets (as multi-targets
are purely a construct of the Cricket grapher).
<p><b>Syntax:</b>
<p>monitor-thresholds = "&lt;monitor-threshold> [ , &lt;monitor-threshold>
... ]"
<p>&lt;monitor-threshold> := &lt;data source>:&lt;monitor type>:&lt;monitor
type args>:&lt;action>:&lt;action args>
<p>&lt;data source> := a data source defined for the target
<br>&lt;monitor type> := One of the six supported types: exact, value,
relation, hunt, quotient, or failures.
<br>&lt;monitor type args> := a colon-delimited list of arguments specific
to each monitor type
<br>&lt;action> := One of five supported actions: SNMP, MAIL, EXEC, FUNC,
or FILE.
<br>&lt;action args> := a colon-delimited list of arguments specific to
each action.
<p><b>Examples:</b>
<br>&nbsp;
<pre>target --default--</pre>

<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; mail-pgm = /usr/bin/mailx</pre>

<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; trap-address = 127.0.0.1</pre>

<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; persistent-alarms = true</pre>

<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; monitor-thresholds =</pre>

<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "ifInOctets : value : n : 262144 : SNMP,</pre>

<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ifInOctets : relation : &lt;10 pct : : : 300 : MAIL :&nbsp; %mail-pgm% : me\\\@mydomain.com,</pre>

<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ifInErrors : quotient : 0.1 pct : : ifInUcastPackets : SNMP"</pre>

<pre>target pop-2</pre>

<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; persistent-alarms = false</pre>

<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; monitor-thresholds = "users : hunt : 40 : pop-1 : users : FILE : /var/log/cricket-alerts"</pre>
The first target, presumably a network link, has three monitor thresholds.
The first generates a SNMP trap whenever the bandwidth exceeds 2 Mbps.
Assuming a polling interval of 300 seconds, the second monitor threshold
checks to see if the current ifInOctets value is within 10% of the value
recorded for the last interval (300 seconds ago). It computes abs(ifInOctets_now
- ifInOctets_then)/ifInOctets_then and compares this with 10% (0.1). If
traffic levels have increased more than 10% over the interval, it invokes
mailx to send a mail message to me@mydomain.com (note the escaped
backslash and escaped '@'). The third monitor threshold checks to see
if input errors exceed 0.1% of input packets. If errors exceed this threshold,
Cricket generates a SNMP trap.
<p>The second target, pop-2, has a single monitor threshold. Cricket will
append an entry to the file /var/log/cricket-alerts when a non-zero number
of users are on pop-2 yet pop-1 has not reached 40 users. Once pop-1 reaches
40 users, or&nbsp; pop-2 returns to a zero user count, the entry will be
cleared from the file.
<p><b>Persistent Alarms</b>
<p>By default, the target tag persistent-alarms is set to false. With this
setting, the first time a monitor threshold criteria fails, the action
is executed.&nbsp; Specifically, the Alarm() subroutine in the Monitor.pm
module is invoked; the action and its arguments are passed as arguments.
If the criteria continues to fail (at subsequent data collection passes),
the action is not executed again. After one or more failures, the first
time the monitor threshold criteria passes, the action is executed. In
this case, the Clear() subroutine in the Monitor.pm module is invoked,
with appropriate action and action arguments.&nbsp; Thus the default behavior
is like a switch that toggles states when the result of the monitor threshold
criteria changes.
<p>If the target tag persistent-alarms is true, the action is executed
(the Alarm subroutine is invoked) every time the monitor threshold criteria
fails. An action (and Clear subroutine) is still executed once the first
time the criteria passes after a string of failures. With persistent-alarms
set to true, monitor threshold behavior is like a bell. It keeps ringing
until the problem stops.
<p><b>Monitor Types</b>
<p>The monitor type determines the criteria used to check a monitor threshold.
<p>Exact monitors are the simplest to use and configure, and allow you to
monitor a datasource for an exact match.  This is useful in cases
where an enumerated (or boolean) SNMP object instruments a condition
where a transition to a specific state requires attention.  For
example, a datasource might return either true(1) or false(2),
depending on whether or not a power supply has failed.  The exact
monitor expects one argument; the value on which the monitor will
trigger.  For example, <tt>monitor-thresholds =
"dsPowerFail:exact:1"</tt> would cause Cricket to send a trap when the
last value of the "dsPowerFail" datasource in the RRD file for this
target is 1.
<p>value : The next simplest monitor type, value monitor thresholds take two
arguments, a minimum and maximum value. If the data source strays outside
of this interval, the monitor threshold criteria fails. To omit the minimum
or maximum value, use the character "n".
<p>relation : Relation monitor thresholds are very flexible. A relation
monitor considers the difference between two data sources (possibly from
different targets), or alternatively, the difference between two temporally
distinct values for the same data source. The first data source is the
data source for which the relation monitor threshold is defined. The difference
can be expressed as absolute value, or as a percentage of the second data
source (comparison) value. This difference is compared to a threshold argument
with either the greater than or less than operator. The criteria fails
when the expression (&lt;absolute or relative difference> &lt;either greater-than
or less-than> &lt;threshold>) evaluates to false. The four colon-delimited
arguments for a relation monitor are:
<ol>
<li>
The threshold number, optionally preceded by the greater than (>) or less
than (&lt;) symbol, and optionally followed by the string "pct". If omitted,
greater than is used by default and the expression, difference > threshold,
is evaluated.&nbsp; "&lt;10 pct", ">1000", "50 pct", and "500" are all
examples of valid thresholds.</li>

<li>
The name of the comparison target. The comparison target must either share
the same path with the first target or be fully-qualified. This argument
is optional and if omitted the first target is also taken as the comparison
target.</li>

<li>
The name of the comparison data source. This data source must belong to
the comparison target. This argument is optional and if omitted the monitor
threshold data source name is also taken as the comparison data source
name.</li>

<li>
The temporal offset in seconds to go back in the RRD file that is being
fetched from for comparison. Note that a data source value must exist in
the RRD file for that exact offset. Choose a multiple of the RRD file step
size. This argument is optional and if omitted, it is set to 0.</li>
</ol>
quotient : Quotient monitor thresholds are similar to relation monitor
thresholds, except that they consider the quotient of two data sources,
or alternatively, the same data source at two different time points. For
a quotient monitor threshold, Cricket computes the value of the first data
source as a percentage of the value second data source (such as 10 is 50%
of 20). This percentage is then compared to a threshold argument with either
the greater than or less than operator. The criteria fails when the expression
(&lt;percentage> &lt;either greater-than or less-than> &lt;threshold>)
evaluates to true. The four colon-delimited arguments for a quotient monitor
are:
<ol>
<li>
The threshold number, optionally preceded by the greater than (>) or less
than (&lt;) symbol followed by the string&nbsp; "pct". If omitted, greater
than is used by default and the expression, difference > threshold, is
evaluated.</li>

<li>
The name of the comparison target. The comparison target must either share
the same path with the first target or be fully-qualified. This argument
is optional and if omitted the first target is also taken as the comparison
target.</li>

<li>
The name of the comparison data source. This data source must belong to
the comparison target. This argument is optional and if omitted the monitor
threshold data source name is also taken as the comparison data source
name.</li>

<li>
The temporal offset in seconds to go back in the RRD file that is being
fetched from for comparison. Note that a data source value must exist in
the RRD file for that exact offset. Choose a multiple of the RRD file step
size. This argument is optional and if omitted, it is set to 0.</li>
</ol>
hunt: The hunt monitor threshold is designed for the situation where the
data source serves as an overflow for another data source; that is, if
one data source (the parent) is at or near capacity, then traffic will
begin to appear on this (the monitored) data source.&nbsp; One application
of hunt monitor thresholds is to identify premature rollover in a set of
modem banks configured to hunt from one to the next.&nbsp; Specifically,
the criteria of the hunt monitor threshold fails if the value of the monitored
data source is non-zero and the current value of the parent data source
falls below a specified capacity threshold. The three colon-delimited arguments
for a hunt monitor are:
<br>&nbsp;
<ol>
<li>
The threshold of the parent data source. Generally this should be slightly
less than the maximum capacity of the target.</li>

<li>
The name of the parent target. The parent target must either share the
same path with the monitored target or be fully-qualified. This argument
is optional and if omitted the monitored target is also taken as the parent
target.</li>

<li>
The name of the parent data source. This data source must belong to the
parent target. This argument is optional and if omitted the monitor threshold
data source name is also take as the comparison data source name</li>
</ol>
failures: The failures monitor threshold is integrated with aberrant behavior
detection in RRDtool. This requires a 1.1.x version of RRDtool and aberrant
behavior detection to be enabled/configured for the target. Visit <a href="http://cricket.sourceforge.net/aberrant">http://cricket.sourceforge.net/aberrant</a>
for more information.
<p><b>Actions</b>
<p>After the monitor threshold is checked for the current value, Cricket
may execute one of several actions.&nbsp; Each action requires one or more
arguments, which appear as a colon-delimited list following the action
tag in the monitor threshold specification.
<p>SNMP: Generating a SNMP trap is the default action if the action tag
is omitted from a monitor threshold specification. To support this default
and for backwards compatibility, the action SNMP does not use the action
arguments field in the monitor threshold specification. The SNMP action
instead requires the attribute trap-address to be set for target. The traps
Cricket sends are marked with the enterprise OID ".1.3.6.1.4.1.2595.1.1".&nbsp;
The generic type is 6 and specific type is 4 for failure (violation) of
the monitor threshold criteria and 5 for success (recall the trap is cleared
on the first success after one or more failures).&nbsp; There are currently
six varbinds: the monitor type,&nbsp; the monitor threshold string, the
target name, data source name, cricket user name (set to "cricket" on Win32
platforms), and instance number (to distinguish targets with multiple instances).
These varbinds are set (and could be customized) in the sendMonitorTrap()
subroutine in Monitor.pm.
<p>MAIL: This action sends email to a specified address via a Berkeley
mailx compatible mail program. The first action argument is the program
to invoke to send email. It is assumed that this program is compatible
with Berkeley mailx. That is, the program accepts piped input as the message
body, and supports a "-s" command flag to specify the subject.&nbsp; If
you don't have such a program on your system, you may wish to customize
the code in the sendEmail() subroutine in Monitor.pm to utilize your email
program. The second action argument is the recipient's email address. Note
that as in the example, you may need to escape special characters. Both
arguments are required. The mail message body includes the following information:
the monitor type, the monitor threshold string, the target name, data source
name, the value of the data source retrieved from the RRD file, and the
instance number (to distinguish targets with multiple instances). To change
the contents of the message, customize the sendEmail() subroutine in Monitor.pm.
<p>FILE: This action appends and deletes entries (lines) from a file. When
the monitor threshold criteria first fails, a line containing details in
a space-delimited format is appended to the file specified as the action
argument (the FILE action has only one argument). Subsequent failures do
not add multiple lines to the file. The FILE action essentially ignores
persistent-alarms = true (though some overhead is incurred to detect duplicate
lines, so persistent-alarms should be set to false when possible for targets
using the FILE action). When the monitor threshold passes again after one
or more failures, the line is deleted from the file.&nbsp; The line details
include the target name and the data source name. To include other details,
customize the LogToFile() subroutine in Monitor.pm.
<p>EXEC: This action executes a shell command or script. The first action
argument is the shell command or script to execute when the monitor threshold
criteria fails. The second action argument is the shell command or script
to execute when the monitor threshold passes again after one or more failures.
The EXEC action provides a mechanism by which automated corrective action
can be taken.
<p>FUNC: This action is similar to EXEC, except that a perl subroutine
defined in the Cricket scope is executed. The first action argument is
the function invoked when the monitor threshold criteria fails. The second
action argument is the function invoked when the monitor threshold passes
again after one or more failures.&nbsp; To use this action, you must first
modify the entry in the func.pm module to set the global variable gMonFuncEnabled.
Using this action requires customization (you must write the subroutines).
While this mechanism provides complete flexibility in handling special
cases, the invoked subroutines cannot easily accept arguments (this can
be done, but the argument list must be included by name in the action arguments
which can quickly become unwieldy). If your function requires access to
arguments available in the Alarm() and Clear() functions, you might consider
adding a new action tag (and sharing your work with the Cricket community).
