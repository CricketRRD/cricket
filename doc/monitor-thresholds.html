		<h1>Understanding and Utilizing Cricket Monitor Thresholds</h1>
		<p>
			Although designed as a real-time data collection and trending
			tool, real-time alerts (or alarms) are a natural extended
			functionality for Cricket. Unfortunately, because they are not a
			part of the core design, the alert mechanisms in Cricket are not
			as cleanly implemented or efficient as they could be. If your
			interest is purely in a tool to generate real-time alerts, then
			Cricket is probably not the best choice. But if you already
			utilize Cricket for data collection and real-time trend analysis
			and you have the additional need for some light real-time
			alerting mechanism, then Cricket can meet your needs.
		</p>
		<p>
			In Cricket, the alert mechanism is called a monitor threshold.
			Monitor thresholds are set (or enabled) for specific data
			sources through the monitor-thresholds target dictionary tag.
			After the data collection pass, Cricket processes each monitor
			threshold by retrieving the most recent value of a data source
			from the RRD file and applying some criteria specific to the
			monitor threshold type. This criteria generates either a pass or
			fail condition. Depending on the setting of the
			persistent-alarms tag for the target, Cricket executes a
			specified action.
		</p>
		<p>
			Note that the most recent value of a data source from the RRD
			file will not necessarily agree with the most recent value
			fetched from by the collector because RRDtool
			interpolates.&nbsp; For those familiar with RRD tool internals,
			the "most recent value" is retreived from the first RRA in the
			file with a consolidation function of AVERAGE. The order of RRAs
			in the file is specified by the rra tag in the targetType
			dictionary.
		</p>
		<p>
			Note that a monitor threshold configured for a multi-instance
			(aka vector instances) target will be checked and an action
			possibly executed for each instance. Monitor thresholds are not
			supported for multi-targets (as multi-targets are purely a
			construct of the Cricket grapher).

  <h2>Explaining the Examples </h2>
  <pre>target network-link-1
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; monitor-thresholds =
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "ifInOctets : value : n : 250000 : SNMP,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ifInOctets : relation : &lt;10 pct : : : 300 : MAIL :&nbsp; %mail-pgm% : me\\\@mydomain.com,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ifInErrors : quotient : 0.1 pct : : ifInUcastPackets : SNMP"</pre>
  <p> The first target, <i>network-link-1</i>, has three monitor thresholds.</p>
</div>
<ul>
  <li> 
    <div>The first generates an SNMP trap whenever the utilized bandwidth, ifInOctets, 
      exceeds 2 Mbps (2000000bits /8 = 250000 octets). It is important to note 
      that all entries defined in the --default-- section will be inhereted by 
      each target. In this case, persistent-alarms = true, has a direct impact 
      when the action will be executed.</div>
  </li>
  <li> 
    <div>The second monitor threshold, checks to see if the current bandwidth, 
      ifInOctets, has a value that is within 10% of the value recorded for the 
      last interval (300 seconds ago; assuming an rrd-poll-interval of 300 seconds). 
      It computes abs(ifInOctets_now - ifInOctets_then)/ifInOctets then and compares 
      this with 10% (0.1). If traffic levels have increased more than 10% over 
      the interval, it invokes mailx to send a mail message to me@mydomain.com 
      (note the escaped backslash and escaped '@'). This action will also be executed 
      everytime the threshold is crossed due to the inherited persistent-alarms.</div>
  </li>
  <li> 
    <div>The third monitor threshold checks to see if input errors, ifInErrors, 
      exceed 0.1% of input packets, ifInUcastPackets. If errors exceed this threshold, 
      Cricket generates an SNMP trap. </div>
  </li>
</ul>
<div> 
  <pre>
target pop-2
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; persistent-alarms = false
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; monitor-thresholds = 
     "users : hunt : 40 : pop-1 : users : FILE : /var/log/cricket-alerts"
   </pre>
  <p> The second target, <i>pop-2</i>, has a single monitor threshold. </p>
</div>
<ul>
  <li> 
    <div>Cricket will append an entry to the file /var/log/cricket-alerts when 
      a non-zero number of users, popUsers, are on pop-2 yet pop-1 has not reached 
      40 users. Once pop-1 reaches 40 users, or&nbsp; pop-2 returns to a zero 
      user count, the entry will be cleared from the file. A target can always 
      redefine a variable that was set in the --default-- section or inhereted 
      from lower in the config tree. In this case persistent-alarms are reset 
      to the default value of false. Hence, the FILE action will be executed to 
      set the alarm when the alarm condition is first detected and once to clear 
      the alarm when the alarm condition is cleared.</div>
  </li>
</ul>
<div> 
  <pre>
target router-chassis
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; persistent-alarms = false
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; monitor-thresholds = 
    "cpu1min : value : n : 60 : META : router-cpu : yellow,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; cpu1min : value : n : 90 : META : router-cpu : red : SPAN : 3,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; mem5minUsed : quotient : &gt;60pct : : processorRam: META"
   </pre>
  <p> The third target, <i>router-chassis</i>, has a three monitor thresholds. 
  </p>
</div>
<ul>
  <li> 
    <div>The first two make use of the value monitor type to establish thresholds 
      on cpu usage. More than one identical monitor type can be applied against 
      the same datasource. In both cases, the META action is called with different 
      arguments.</div>
  </li>
  <li>In the second value monitor, the keyword SPAN indicates there is an additional 
    condition where the monitor threshold will only trigger an alarm when three 
    consecutive monitor threshold tests fail. At the first threshold test pass, 
    the alarm will be cleared. </li>
  <li> 
    <div>The last monitor type will calculate mem5minUsed datasource divided by 
      the processorRAM datasource and if the percentage is greater than 60% it 
      will trigger a META action. Note that no additional arguments have been 
      added to the META action, this is by design, read the Actions section for 
      details on how to use this and other actions. </div>
  </li>
</ul>
<div>
			<h2>Persistent Alarms</h2>
			<p>
				By default, the target tag persistent-alarms is set to
				false. With this setting, the first time a monitor threshold
				criteria fails, the action is executed.&nbsp; Specifically,
				the Alarm() subroutine in the Monitor.pm module is invoked;
				the action and its arguments are passed as arguments. If the
				criteria continues to fail (at subsequent data collection
				passes), the action is not executed again. After one or more
				failures, the first time the monitor threshold criteria
				passes, the action is executed. In this case, the Clear()
				subroutine in the Monitor.pm module is invoked, with
				appropriate action and action arguments.&nbsp; Thus the
				default behavior is like a switch that toggles states when
				the result of the monitor threshold criteria changes.
			</p>
			<p>
				If the target tag persistent-alarms is true, the action is
				executed (the Alarm subroutine is invoked) every time the
				monitor threshold criteria fails. An action (and Clear
				subroutine) is still executed once the first time the
				criteria passes after a string of failures. With
				persistent-alarms set to true, monitor threshold behavior is
				like a bell. It keeps ringing until the problem stops.
			</p>
		</div>

		<div>
			<h2>Monitor Types</h2>
			<p>
				The monitor type determines the criteria used to check a
				monitor threshold.
			</p>
			
  <p> exact : </p>
  <p>These monitors are the simplest to use and configure, and allow you to monitor 
    a datasource for an exact match. This is useful in cases where an enumerated 
    (or boolean) SNMP object instruments a condition where a transition to a specific 
    state requires attention. For example, a datasource might return either true(1) 
    or false(2), depending on whether or not a power supply has failed. The exact 
    monitor expects one argument; the value on which the monitor will trigger. 
    For example, <tt>monitor-thresholds = "dsPowerFail:exact:1"</tt> would cause 
    Cricket to send a trap when the last value of the "dsPowerFail" datasource 
    in the RRD file for this target is 1. </p>
  <pre>    dsPowerFail : exact : 1 : &lt;ACTION&gt; : ...
    dsTempAlarm : exact : 1 : &lt;ACTION&gt; : ...
  </pre>
			
  <p> value : </p>
  <p>The next simplest monitor type, value monitor thresholds take two arguments, 
    a minimum and maximum value. If the data source strays outside of this interval, 
    the monitor threshold criteria fails. To omit the minimum or maximum value, 
    use the character "n". </p>
  <pre>    temperature : value : 30 : 90 : &lt;ACTION&gt; : ...
    ifInOctets : value : n : 250000 : &lt;ACTION&gt; : ...
 </pre>
  <p>relation : </p>
  <p>Relation monitor thresholds are very flexible. A relation monitor considers 
    the difference between two data sources (possibly from different targets), 
    or alternatively, the difference between two temporally distinct values for 
    the same data source. The first data source is the data source for which the 
    relation monitor threshold is defined. The difference can be expressed as 
    absolute value, or as a percentage of the second data source (comparison) 
    value. This difference is compared to a threshold argument with either the 
    greater than or less than operator. The criteria fails when the expression 
    (&lt;absolute or relative difference> &lt;either greater-than or less-than> 
    &lt;threshold>) evaluates to false. The four colon-delimited arguments for 
    a relation monitor are: </p>
			
  <ol>
    <li> The threshold number, optionally preceded by the greater than (>) or 
      less than (&lt;) symbol, and optionally followed by the string "pct". If 
      omitted, greater than is used by default and the expression, difference 
      > threshold, is evaluated.&nbsp; "&lt;10 pct", ">1000", "50 pct", and "500" 
      are all examples of valid thresholds. </li>
    <li> The name of the comparison target. The comparison target must either 
      share the same path with the first target or be fully-qualified. This argument 
      is optional and if omitted the first target is also taken as the comparison 
      target. </li>
    <li> The name of the comparison data source. This data source must belong 
      to the comparison target. This argument is optional and if omitted the monitor 
      threshold data source name is also taken as the comparison data source name. 
    </li>
    <li> The temporal offset in seconds to go back in the RRD file that is being 
      fetched from for comparison. Note that a data source value must exist in 
      the RRD file for that exact offset. Choose a multiple of the RRD file step 
      size. This argument is optional and if omitted, it is set to 0. </li>
  </ol>
  <p>quotient : </p>
  <p>Quotient monitor thresholds are similar to relation monitor thresholds, except 
    that they consider the quotient of two data sources, or alternatively, the 
    same data source at two different time points. For a quotient monitor threshold, 
    Cricket computes the value of the first data source as a percentage of the 
    value second data source (such as 10 is 50% of 20). This percentage is then 
    compared to a threshold argument with either the greater than or less than 
    operator. The criteria fails when the expression (&lt;percentage> &lt;either 
    greater-than or less-than> &lt;threshold>) evaluates to true. The four colon-delimited 
    arguments for a quotient monitor are: </p>
			<ol>
				<li>
					The threshold number, optionally preceded by the
					greater than (>) or less than (&lt;) symbol followed
					by the string&nbsp; "pct". If omitted, greater than
					is used by default and the expression, difference >
					threshold, is evaluated.
				</li>
				<li>
					The name of the comparison target. The comparison
					target must either share the same path with the
					first target or be fully-qualified. This argument is
					optional and if omitted the first target is also
					taken as the comparison target.
				</li>
				<li>
					The name of the comparison data source. This data
					source must belong to the comparison target. This
					argument is optional and if omitted the monitor
					threshold data source name is also taken as the
					comparison data source name.
				</li>
				<li>
					The temporal offset in seconds to go back in the RRD
					file that is being fetched from for comparison. Note
					that a data source value must exist in the RRD file
					for that exact offset. Choose a multiple of the RRD
					file step size. This argument is optional and if
					omitted, it is set to 0.
				</li>
			</ol>
			
  <p> hunt: </p>
  <p>The hunt monitor threshold is designed for the situation where the data source 
    serves as an overflow for another data source; that is, if one data source 
    (the parent) is at or near capacity, then traffic will begin to appear on 
    this (the monitored) data source.&nbsp; One application of hunt monitor thresholds 
    is to identify premature rollover in a set of modem banks configured to hunt 
    from one to the next.&nbsp; Specifically, the criteria of the hunt monitor 
    threshold fails if the value of the monitored data source is non-zero and 
    the current value of the parent data source falls below a specified capacity 
    threshold. The three colon-delimited arguments for a hunt monitor are: </p>
			<ol>
				<li>
					The threshold of the parent data source. Generally
					this should be slightly less than the maximum
					capacity of the target.
				</li>
				<li>
					The name of the parent target. The parent target
					must either share the same path with the monitored
					target or be fully-qualified. This argument is
					optional and if omitted the monitored target is also
					taken as the parent target.
				</li>
				<li>
					The name of the parent data source. This data source
					must belong to the parent target. This argument is
					optional and if omitted the monitor threshold data
					source name is also take as the comparison data
					source name.
				</li>
			</ol>
			
  <p> failures: </p>
  <p>The failures monitor threshold is integrated with aberrant behavior detection 
    in RRDtool. This monitor checks the FAILURES RRA for the target and datasource. 
    If the current value is 1, this indicates aberrant behavior. Aberrant behavior 
    detection must be enabled for the target, which requires RRDtool 1.1.x. This 
    threshold may be conditioned on the current value of the datasource. In this 
    case, the threshold is only triggered when both the FAILURES RRA is 1 and 
    the current value of the data source is within a specified range. This range 
    is specified via two colon-delimited arguments; the first is the min or "n" 
    to specify no lower bound and the second is the max or "n" to specify no upper 
    bound. </p>
		</div>

		<div>
			
  <h2>Alarm Actions</h2>
			<p>
				After the monitor threshold is checked for the current
				value, Cricket may execute one of several actions.&nbsp;
				Each action requires one or more arguments, which appear
				as a colon-delimited list following the action tag in
				the monitor threshold specification.
			</p>
			<p>
				SNMP: Generating a SNMP trap is the default action if
				the action tag is omitted from a monitor threshold
				specification. To support this default and for backwards
				compatibility, the action SNMP does not use the action
				arguments field in the monitor threshold specification.
				The SNMP action instead requires the attribute
				trap-address to be set for target. The traps Cricket
				sends are marked with the enterprise OID
				".1.3.6.1.4.1.2595.1.1".&nbsp; The generic type is 6 and
				specific type is 4 for failure (violation) of the
				monitor threshold criteria and 5 for success (recall the
				trap is cleared on the first success after one or more
				failures).&nbsp; There are currently nine varbinds: the
				monitor type,&nbsp; the monitor threshold string, the
				target name, data source name, cricket user name (set to
				"cricket" on Win32 platforms), instance number (to
				distinguish targets with multiple instances), instance name,
				contact name (based on the html dictionary entry contact-name),
				and data value. These
				varbinds are set (and could be customized) in the
				sendMonitorTrap() subroutine in Monitor.pm.
			</p>
			<p>
				MAIL: This action sends email to a specified address via
				a Berkeley mailx compatible mail program. The first
				action argument is the program to invoke to send email.
				It is assumed that this program is compatible with
				Berkeley mailx. That is, the program accepts piped input
				as the message body, and supports a "-s" command flag to
				specify the subject.&nbsp; If you don't have such a
				program on your system, you may wish to customize the
				code in the sendEmail() subroutine in Monitor.pm to
				utilize your email program. The second action argument
				is the recipient's email address. Note that as in the
				example, you may need to escape special characters. Both
				arguments are required. The mail message body includes
				the following information: the monitor type, the monitor
				threshold string, the target name, data source name, the
				value of the data source retrieved from the RRD file,
				and the instance number (to distinguish targets with
				multiple instances). To change the contents of the
				message, customize the sendEmail() subroutine in
				Monitor.pm.
			</p>
			<p>
				FILE: This action appends and deletes entries (lines)
				from a file. When the monitor threshold criteria first
				fails, a line containing details in a space-delimited
				format is appended to the file specified as the action
				argument (the FILE action has only one argument).
				Subsequent failures do not add multiple lines to the
				file. The FILE action essentially ignores
				persistent-alarms = true (though some overhead is
				incurred to detect duplicate lines, so persistent-alarms
				should be set to false when possible for targets using
				the FILE action). When the monitor threshold passes
				again after one or more failures, the line is deleted
				from the file.&nbsp; The line details include the target
				name and the data source name. To include other details,
				customize the LogToFile() subroutine in Monitor.pm.
			</p>
			<p>
				EXEC: This action executes a shell command or script.
				The first action argument is the shell command or script
				to execute when the monitor threshold criteria fails.
				The second action argument is the shell command or
				script to execute when the monitor threshold passes
				again after one or more failures. The EXEC action
				provides a mechanism by which automated corrective
				action can be taken.
			</p>
			<p>
				FUNC: This action is similar to EXEC, except that a perl
				subroutine defined in the Cricket scope is executed. The
				first action argument is the function invoked when the
				monitor threshold criteria fails. The second action
				argument is the function invoked when the monitor
				threshold passes again after one or more failures.&nbsp;
				To use this action, you must first modify the entry in
				the func.pm module to set the global variable
				gMonFuncEnabled. Using this action requires
				customization (you must write the subroutines). While
				this mechanism provides complete flexibility in handling
				special cases, the invoked subroutines cannot easily
				accept arguments (this can be done, but the argument
				list must be included by name in the action arguments
				which can quickly become unwieldy). If your function
				requires access to arguments available in the Alarm()
				and Clear() functions, you might consider adding a new
				action tag (and sharing your work with the Cricket
				community).
			</p>
			
  <p> META: This action is meant to be used to shared threshold monitoring event 
    data with other external systems. This action does nothing. In the sense, 
    that no external action is initiated. There is no mail sent, no SNMP trap 
    generated or any other specific action. What it does is let cricket know the 
    fact that an alarm has been generated or cleared. Cricket stores all active 
    alarms in an internal format call meta files. These files are stored in the 
    cricket-data directory along side each target.rrd file that has monitor-thresholds 
    defined for it. The meta files store alarm data for all Action types.The monitor-threshold 
    line itself and other data is stored in the meta file. Arguments are arbitrary.</p>
  <p>Using this action requires customization (you must write the external interface 
    script). The most common uses for this are for sharing event data with event 
    management systems such as NetCool, BigBrother and others. Event management 
    systems often support SNMP, proprietary agents or APIs. This permits a flexible 
    way of interacting with these systems with something other than an SNMP trap.</p>
  <p>To provide this, your external script must load the config-tree in memory, 
    query it for active alarms and configured monitoring thresholds and send messages 
    in the appropriate format to the event manager. An example script is provided 
    in the util directory of the Cricket distribution, metaQuery.pl. Note that 
    this is not to be mistaken with real time monitoring, as you have to wait 
    for the collector run to be finished before querying the config-tree or else 
    risk missing a new alarm until the next query.</p>
  <div>
    <p></p>
  </div>
  <div> 
    <h2>Monitoring Span</h2>
    <p> Cricket monitoring thresholds can be extended to look for consecutive 
      threshold failures. The SPAN keyword will require a threshold to be crossed 
      an arbitrary number of consecutive times before triggering an alarm. The 
      keyword SPAN and a span-length value are required to enable this action. 
      At the first threshold verification that passes, the alarm will be cleared. 
      Threshold crosses that have not been promoted to alarms are stored in the 
      meta file associated with the monitored target. Using the following meta 
      file format:</p>
    <p>&lt;monitor-threshold&gt; &lt;timestamp-of-first-failure&gt; failure lastval 
      &lt;ds-value-at-time-of-first-failure&gt;</p>
    <p>When the time stamp of a threshold cross is older than &lt;span-length&gt; 
      * %rrd-poll-interval%, an alarm is generated. This option is fully compatible 
      with the persistent-alarms option.</p>
