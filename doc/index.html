<h2> Documentation Roadmap </h2>

At this time, there are two different pieces of documentation
for Cricket. Each is aimed at a slightly different audience.
Depending in how you want to use Cricket, you'll need to read
one or both of them.
<p>

<dl>
<dt> <a href="beginner.html"><tt>beginner.html</tt></a>
<dd> This text document is meant for rank amateur Cricket users.
If you have just downloaded the package and want to get it going,
this is the document for you.
<p>

<dt> <a href="reference.html"><tt>reference.html</tt></a>
<dd> This document is meant to answer any conceivable question
about Cricket. It is the Cricket Bible.
<p>

</dl>

<h2> Support </h2>

Cricket support is offered by the Cricket community
via the mailing list cricket-users@onelist.com.
Go to <a href="http://www.munitions.com/~jra/cricket/lists.html">
http://www.munitions.com/~jra/cricket/lists.html</a>
for more information on this list. Bugs should also be discussed on
this list, so that a patch can be made and integrated into
a future release.
<p>

New releases and additional documentation will be posted on
the Cricket website at:
<a href="http://www.munitions.com/~jra/cricket">
http://www.munitions.com/~jra/cricket</a>.
<p>

I will try to help where I can, because I want to see Cricket succeed
in as many different kinds of installations as possible. Please
remember, however, that my job is to make Cricket solve WebTV's
problems. If your problem is like one I have here, I will be
more likely to work on it. If not, hopefully you will be able to get
help from others in the Cricket community.
<p>

Thanks for using Cricket!
