<h1>A Gentle Introduction to Cricket</h1>

<p>
Cricket was designed to solve several weaknesses WebTV found in MRTG
when we tried to use it with thousands of targets, and for many
different purposes. We found that the more we customized the MRTG
config file, the larger and more unwieldy it got. We found that we
were making mistakes due to the complexity, and then we wrote scripts
to write the configs for us, and using these scripts, we made mistakes
in a faster, more automated manner. Something needed to be done.

<p>
Cricket uses a hierarchical configuration system, thus a complete set of
Cricket config files is called a &quot;config tree&quot;. Configuration
information that will be used again and again can be stored high in
the tree, and inherited by all the leaves. More specific information
can be stored closer to where it is used, but still in one place
(instead of each place it is used). All the way down to the leaves of
the tree, information from higher up can be overridden. Files are
grouped into directories and processed in a predictable order within
those directories. As a directory is processed, the state of the
system is saved and restored. In this way, changes made to the
defaults in a sub-tree do not affect a sibling sub-tree.

<h2> Understanding the config tree </h2>

<p>
Understanding the config tree is critical to understanding how to use
and modify Cricket. Everything Cricket knows it learns from the config
tree. That includes things like which variables to fetch for a certain
type of device, how to fetch those variables, which devices to talk
to, and what type of device they all are. The inheritance property of
the config tree applies equally to all types of data, making it
possible to make a concise description of a large, complicated set of
monitored devices.

<h3> A guided tour </h3>

<p>
In this section, we will take a guided tour of the sample config tree
that ships with Cricket. It would be a very good idea to read this section
with a window open that you can use to explore the sample config tree.

<p>
The first thing to notice about the config tree is that every
directory has a file in it called "Defaults". This file is not strictly
speaking necessary, but you will find it in nearly every level
of every config tree. It's purpose is to hold settings that will
apply to the entire subtree that it sits on top of. Thus, when
you look at the file named <tt>sample-config/Defaults</tt>, it's
important to realize that unless those values get overridden
later, they will be used throughout the entire config tree.

<p>
When Cricket goes to process a directory, it processes the Defaults
file first (if it exists), then it processes each ordinary file,
and finally it processes each of the directories.
When processing a directory, it saves the current configuration
before entering it, and restores the configuration after leaving
the directory. Note that Cricket does not save and restore the
configuration when processing files; one file could make a change to
the defaults that another file in the same directory can see.
For the time being, consider this a feature. It can be useful, as
long as you are expecting it to behave that way.

<p>
Scroll through the root Defaults file and take a look at
the sections. You'll see that each chunk of the file
begins with a certain word (like "target", or "oid"). After
that word, they differ somewhat, but generally what a
chunk does is define some tag/value pairs, and assign them
to some key name. For instance, the tag <tt>rrd-datafile</tt> gets
set to "%dataDir%/%auto-target-name%.rrd".

<p>
That's great, you say, but what are the percent signs
about? This brings us to expansion.
Before a dictionary is used, it is expanded. This means
that variables which are referenced with the "%tag%"
syntax are replaced with their actual values. If the value
also has a variable in it, it is also expanded. (There is no
check for loops so don't accidentally make one!)
This is a very powerful feature which makes complicated
configurations boil down to a few simple config lines.

<p>
For instance, the example I chose above sets the tag
<tt>rrd-datafile</tt> to a proper filename made
up of the data directory, the target name, and the
extension ".rrd". But you'll notice that <tt>dataDir</tt>
is itself defined in terms of some other tags. As long
as all the tags eventually map to some text, the expansion
process turns this mess into a complete pathname. If
a tag is not defined, but it is referenced via an expansion,
then Cricket will log a warning, but it will attempt to
continue to use the partially expanded string.

<p>
The tags that Cricket uses to get it's configuration are
listed below in the reference section, one at a time with a
description. All other tags that appear in the dictionaries in
a config tree are either in use by expansions, or ignored. For
instance, nowhere in the reference section will you find <tt>dataDir</tt>
mentioned. That is simply a tag that exists to make the definition
<tt>rrd-datafile</tt> easier to read. You can add as many of your own tags
as you want; it's all up to how you want to setup your config tree.

<p>
After Cricket expands a string, it scans the string for substrings
surrounded by curly braces (<tt>{like this}</tt>). These substrings
are passed to Perl's <tt>eval()</tt> function, which means you
can do arbitrary math and other nifty trickery between curly braces.
Some day I'll add more examples for how you might use this, but
for now all I'm telling you is that it's there. You have to figure out
how to use it.

<h3>Target types, and datasources</h3>

<p>
Now, let us take a digression for a second to talk about
target types, and datasources. A datasource is something you want to
graph. For instance, "router inlet temperature", or "inbound octets
per second". Datasources that all relate to the same type of device
are grouped together into a target type. A target is a distinct device
from which you will be collecting data. Every target has a target
type, which is how Cricket knows what data to fetch, and how to fetch
it. This is all described in much more detail below, but for now, you
already know enough to get going.  This is because Cricket's sample
config tree comes with lots of predefined target types that will let
you look at common things on your network.

<p>
To see this stuff in action, go into the
<tt>sample-config/routers</tt> directory and take a look at the
Defaults file. What this file is doing is setting things up so that if
you create a target of type "Cisco-7200-Router", Cricket will know
what data to fetch. As you can see by the different target types
defined in this file, not all routers are created equal.  Some can
return temperature, some can't.

<h3> Tacking a Target </h3>

<p>
Now, let's check out a target definition. Note that we've set a number
of tags in the root Defaults file and in the subtree Defaults file
related to the target named <tt>--default--</tt>. This special target
is never used to fetch data. Instead, it is used as kind of a skeleton
for all future targets that are created in the subtree below that
point. Take a look inside the file named <tt>Targets</tt>. This file
defines some real targets. The sample config tree comes with two,
<tt>engineering-router</tt> and <tt>main-router</tt>.  These two
dictionaries are added onto the bottom of the config tree, and are
sometimes referred to as leaves. A leaf is where some work happens.

<p>
When Cricket comes to process the <tt>engineering-router</tt> leaf
node, the first step is to build a working copy of the
dictionary. Clearly the information in the leaf node is not enough to
collect any data from the router. For one thing, we don't know what
the hostname of the router is, so we don't know where to send the SNMP
packets. This is where the <tt>--default--</tt>
dictionaries come in. To make the complete working dictionary for this
part of the config tree, Cricket traverses all the nodes from the root
down to the current node, gathering together the <tt>--default--</tt>
dictionaries. Items lower in the config tree override items higher
up.

<p>
Cricket uses the <tt>target-type</tt> tag to decide what method to use
to fetch the data. If does this by finding a <tt>targetType</tt>
dictionary that matches the <tt>target-type</tt> tag for the current
target. This targetType dictionary has a tag named <tt>ds</tt>, which
is a list of the datasources we expect to fetch from this router.
Each datasource is fetched in the same way, and there Cricket
discovers that it will be talking SNMP to this router, in order to
fetch 6 variables.

<p>
Next, Cricket turns over control to the SNMP fetcher. The fetcher is
trying to turn an SNMP URL into a measurement. The SNMP URL for the
data on the engineering-router is
<tt>snmp://public@engineering-router:161/cpu1min</tt>. But you've
probably already noticed that the only thing the fetcher seems to have
to go on is the <tt>ds-source</tt> tag, which has a <tt>%snmp%</tt>
where we expected to find the community string, hostname and port.

<p>
How does Cricket manufacture the whole SNMP URL for this target?

<h3>Explaining expansion</h3>

<p>
Immediately after Cricket makes the working dictionary for a target it
is working on, it fully expands the target with respect to
itself. Likewise, when Cricket fetches a dictionary like the
<tt>cpu1min</tt> datasource dictionary, it is also expanded with
respect to the target dictionary. By the time the SNMP
fetcher is looking for the contents of the <tt>ds-source</tt> tag, it
has already been expanded to the correct value.

<p>
Let's unwind the expansions that contributed to changing <tt>%snmp%</tt>
into <tt>public@engineering-router:161</tt>.

<blockquote><pre>  From sample-config/Defaults
    snmp-community      = public
    snmp-port           = 161
    snmp                = %snmp-community%@%snmp-host%:%snmp-port%

  From sample-config/routers/Defaults
    router              = %auto-target-name%
    snmp-host           = %router%
</pre></blockquote>

<p>
You can see that one level about the leaf, the <tt>snmp-host</tt> tag
gets set (via the <tt>router</tt> tag) to the name of the current
target. Tags starting with <tt>auto-</tt> are provided to you by
Cricket. There are a number of these automatic tags which are
discussed below. The rest of the <tt>snmp</tt> tag is filled in by
defaults inherited from all the way up at the top of the config tree.

<p>
This is a good example of the power of the config tree. If you were
asked to monitor a new piece of network hardware which had a slightly
different community string, you could put a <tt>snmp-community</tt>
tag in the target's dictionary and override the one normally inherited
from above. Alternatively, if you need to change the community string
on 1000 devices simultaneously, you could do so by simply changing it
at the root, then allowing the change to filter down to each of the
1000 targets in your config tree.
