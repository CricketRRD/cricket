    <h1>A Gentle Introduction to Cricket</h1>
    <p>
      Cricket was designed to solve several weaknesses WebTV found in
      MRTG when we tried to use it with thousands of targets, and for
      many different purposes. We found that the more we customized
      the MRTG config file, the larger and more unwieldy it got. We
      found that we were making mistakes due to the complexity, and
      then we wrote scripts to write the configs for us, and using
      these scripts, we made mistakes in a faster, more automated
      manner. Something needed to be done.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cricket uses a hierarchical configuration system, thus a complete set of
      Cricket config files is called a &ldquo;<dfn>config tree</dfn>&rdquo;.
      Configuration information that will be used again and again can be
      stored high in the tree, and inherited by all the leaves. More specific
      information can be stored closer to where it is used, but still in one
      place (instead of each place it is used). All the way down to the leaves
      of the tree, information from higher up can be overridden. Files are
      grouped into directories and processed in a predictable order within
      those directories. As a directory is processed, the state of the system
      is saved and restored. In this way, changes made to the defaults in a
      sub-tree do not affect a sibling sub-tree.
    </p>

    <div>
      <h2>Understanding the config tree</h2>
      <p>
        Understanding the config tree is critical to understanding
        how to use and modify Cricket. Everything Cricket knows it
        learns from the config tree. That includes things like which
        variables to fetch for a certain type of device, how to
        fetch those variables, which devices to talk to, and what
        type of device they all are. The inheritance property of the
        config tree applies equally to all types of data, making it
        possible to make a concise description of a large,
        complicated set of monitored devices.
      </p>

      <div>
        <h3>A guided tour</h3>
        <p>
          In this section, we will take a guided tour of the
          sample config tree that ships with Cricket. It would be
          a very good idea to read this section with a window open
          that you can use to explore the sample config tree.
        </p>
        <p>
          The first thing to notice about the config tree is that every
          directory has a file in it called
          &ldquo;<code>Defaults</code>&rdquo;. This file is not strictly
          speaking necessary, but you will find it in nearly every level of
          every config tree. It's purpose is to hold settings that will apply
          to the entire subtree that it sits on top of. Thus, when you look at
          the file named &ldquo;<code>sample-config/Defaults</code>&rdquo;,
          it's important to realize that unless those values get overridden
          later, they will be used throughout the entire config tree.
        </p>
        <p>
          When Cricket goes to process a directory, it processes the
          &ldquo;<code>Defaults</code>&rdquo; file first (if it exists), then
          it processes each ordinary file, and finally it processes each of
          the directories. When processing a directory, it saves the current
          configuration before entering it, and restores the configuration
          after leaving the directory. Note that Cricket does not save and
          restore the configuration when processing files; one file could make
          a change to the defaults that another file in the same directory can
          see. For the time being, consider this a feature. It can be useful,
          as long as you are expecting it to behave that way.
        </p>
        <p>
          Scroll through the root &ldquo;<code>Defaults</code>&rdquo; file and
          take a look at the sections. You'll see that each chunk of the file
          begins with a certain word (like &ldquo;<code>target</code>&rdquo;,
          or &ldquo;<code>oid</code>&rdquo;). After that word, they differ
          somewhat, but generally what a chunk does is define some tag/value
          pairs, and assign them to some key name. For instance, the tag
          &ldquo;<code>rrd-datafile</code>&rdquo; gets set to
          &ldquo;<code>%dataDir%/%auto-target-name%.rrd</code>&rdquo;.
        </p>
        <p>
          That's great, you say, but what are the percent signs about? This
          brings us to <dfn>expansion</dfn>. Before a dictionary is used, it
          is expanded. This means that variables which are referenced with the
          &ldquo;<code>%tag%</code>&rdquo; syntax are replaced with their
          actual values. If the value also has a variable in it, it is also
          expanded. (There is no check for loops so don't accidentally make
          one!) This is a very powerful feature which makes complicated
          configurations boil down to a few simple config lines.
        </p>
        <p>
          For instance, the example I chose above sets the tag
          &ldquo;<code>rrd-datafile</code>&rdquo; to a proper filename made up
          of the data directory, the target name, and the extension
          &ldquo;<code>.rrd</code>&rdquo;. But you'll notice that
          &ldquo;<code>dataDir</code>&rdquo; is itself defined in terms of
          some other tags. As long as all the tags eventually map to some
          text, the expansion process turns this mess into a complete
          pathname. If a tag is not defined, but it is referenced via an
          expansion, then Cricket will log a warning, but it will attempt to
          continue to use the partially expanded string.
        </p>
        <p>
          The tags that Cricket uses to get it's configuration are listed
          below in the reference section, one at a time with a description.
          All other tags that appear in the dictionaries in a config tree are
          either in use by expansions, or ignored. For instance, nowhere in
          the reference section will you find
          &ldquo;<code>dataDir</code>&rdquo; mentioned. That is simply a tag
          that exists to make the definition
          &ldquo;<code>rrd-datafile</code>&rdquo; easier to read. You can add
          as many of your own tags as you want; it's all up to how you want to
          setup your config tree.
        </p>
        <p>
          After Cricket expands a string, it scans the string for substrings
          surrounded by curly braces (&ldquo;<code>{like this}</code>&rdquo;).
          These substrings are passed to Perl's
          &ldquo;<code>eval()</code>&rdquo; function, which means you can do
          arbitrary math and other nifty trickery between curly braces. Some
          day I'll add more examples for how you might use this, but for now
          all I'm telling you is that it's there. You have to figure out how
          to use it.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div>
        <h3>Target types, and datasources</h3>
        <p>
          Now, let us take a digression for a second to talk about target
          types, and datasources. A datasource is something you want to graph.
          For instance, &ldquo;router inlet temperature&rdquo;, or
          &ldquo;inbound octets per second&rdquo;. Datasources that all relate
          to the same type of device are grouped together into a target type.
          A target is a distinct device from which you will be collecting
          data. Every target has a target type, which is how Cricket knows
          what data to fetch, and how to fetch it. This is all described in
          much more detail below, but for now, you already know enough to get
          going.  This is because Cricket's sample config tree comes with lots
          of predefined target types that will let you look at common things
          on your network.
        </p>
        <p>
          To see this stuff in action, go into the
          &ldquo;<code>sample-config/routers</code>&rdquo; directory and take
          a look at the &ldquo;<code>Defaults</code>&rdquo; file. What this
          file is doing is setting things up so that if you create a target of
          type &ldquo;<code>Cisco-7200-Router</code>&rdquo;, Cricket will know
          what data to fetch. As you can see by the different target types
          defined in this file, not all routers are created equal. Some can
          return temperature, some can't.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div>
        <h3>Tacking a Target</h3>
        <p>
          Now, let's check out a target definition. Note that we've set a
          number of tags in the root Defaults file and in the subtree Defaults
          file related to the target named
          &ldquo;<code>--default--</code>&rdquo;. This special target is never
          used to fetch data. Instead, it is used as kind of a skeleton for
          all future targets that are created in the subtree below that point.
          Take a look inside the file named
          &ldquo;<code>Targets</code>&rdquo;. This file defines some real
          targets. The sample config tree comes with two,
          &ldquo;<code>engineering-router</code>&rdquo; and
          &ldquo;<code>main-router</code>&rdquo;. These two dictionaries are
          added onto the bottom of the config tree, and are sometimes referred
          to as leaves. A leaf is where some work happens.
        </p>
        <p>
          When Cricket comes to process the
          &ldquo;<code>engineering-router</code>&rdquo; leaf node, the first
          step is to build a working copy of the dictionary. Clearly the
          information in the leaf node is not enough to collect any data from
          the router. For one thing, we don't know what the hostname of the
          router is, so we don't know where to send the SNMP packets. This is
          where the &ldquo;<code>--default--</code>&rdquo; dictionaries come
          in. To make the complete working dictionary for this part of the
          config tree, Cricket traverses all the nodes from the root down to
          the current node, gathering together the
          &ldquo;<code>--default--</code>&rdquo; dictionaries. Items lower in
          the config tree override items higher up.
        </p>
        <p>
          Cricket uses the &ldquo;<code>target-type</code>&rdquo; tag to
          decide what method to use to fetch the data. If does this by finding
          a &ldquo;<code>targetType</code>&rdquo; dictionary that matches the
          &ldquo;<code>target-type</code>&rdquo; tag for the current target.
          This targetType dictionary has a tag named
          &ldquo;<code>ds</code>&rdquo;, which is a list of the datasources we
          expect to fetch from this router. Each datasource is fetched in the
          same way, and there Cricket discovers that it will be talking SNMP
          to this router, in order to fetch 6 variables.
        </p>
        <p>
          Next, Cricket turns over control to the SNMP fetcher. The fetcher is
          trying to turn an SNMP URL into a measurement. The SNMP URL for the
          data on the &ldquo;<code>engineering-router</code>&rdquo; is
          &ldquo;<code>snmp://public@engineering-router:161/cpu1min</code>&
          rdquo;. But you've probably already noticed that the only thing the
          fetcher seems to have to go on is the
          &ldquo;<code>ds-source</code>&rdquo; tag, which has a
          &ldquo;<code>%snmp%</code>&rdquo; where we expected to find the
          community string, hostname and port.
        </p>
        <p>
          How does Cricket manufacture the whole SNMP URL for this target?
        </p>
      </div>

      <div>
        <h3>Explaining expansion</h3>
        <p>
          Immediately after Cricket makes the working dictionary for a target
          it is working on, it fully expands the target with respect to
          itself. Likewise, when Cricket fetches a dictionary like the
          &ldquo;<code>cpu1min</code>&rdquo; datasource dictionary, it is also
          expanded with respect to the target dictionary. By the time the SNMP
          fetcher is looking for the contents of the
          &ldquo;<code>ds-source</code>&rdquo; tag, it has already been
          expanded to the correct value.
        </p>
        <p>
          Let's unwind the expansions that contributed to changing
          &ldquo;<code>%snmp%</code>&rdquo; into
          &ldquo;<code>public@engineering-router:161</code>&rdquo;.
        </p>
        <code class="block">
From &ldquo;sample-config/Defaults&rdquo;:
  snmp-community = public
  snmp-port      = 161
  snmp           = %snmp-community%@%snmp-host%:%snmp-port%

From &ldquo;sample-config/routers/Defaults&rdquo;:
  router         = %auto-target-name%
  snmp-host      = %router%
        </code>
        <p>
          You can see that one level about the leaf, the
          &ldquo;<code>snmp-host</code>&rdquo; tag gets set (via the
          &ldquo;<code>router</code>&rdquo; tag) to the name of the current
          target. Tags starting with &ldquo;<code>auto-</code>&rdquo; are
          provided to you by Cricket. There are a number of these automatic
          tags which are discussed below. The rest of the
          &ldquo;<code>snmp</code>&rdquo; tag is filled in by defaults
          inherited from all the way up at the top of the config tree.
        </p>
        <p>
          This is a good example of the power of the config tree. If you were
          asked to monitor a new piece of network hardware which had a
          slightly different community string, you could put a
          &ldquo;<code>snmp-community</code>&rdquo; tag in the target's
          dictionary and override the one normally inherited from above.
          Alternatively, if you need to change the community string on 1000
          devices simultaneously, you could do so by simply changing it at the
          root, then allowing the change to filter down to each of the 1000
          targets in your config tree.
