<h1>The Perfmon Reference Guide</h1>

<p>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>
Perfmon in Cricket is a bit tricky to master but ultimately worth it if you 
wish to do long-term performance trending on the many useful perfmon counters 
in NT.
<p>
One thing which makes it so tricky to use perfmon counters is that many of them
are "raw" counters which require the use of derived, and computed historical
data to extract any meaning from them. RRDtool makes it easy to perform the
computations. With a bit of research you can easily discover what you need
to feed into the Cricket configuration to get useful data.
<p>
<h2>Assumptions</h2>
<p>
This document assumes the following. You have a working Cricket installation,
you have some knowledge of Perfmon and how it works (run perfmon.exe for a 
crash course), you're attempting to extract data from a box running the
Windows(tm) operating system, you have some knowledge of RPN (Reverse Polish
Notation), and finally you feel comfortable to make very light modifications
to the Cricket code during the "discovery process".
<p>
<h2>ds-source Parameters</h2>
<p>
Here is a breakdown of what the perfmon ds-source requires to operate:
<p>
<tt>perfmon:host-name:object name:counter name:instance name:special options</tt>
<p>
<li><tt>perfmon</tt> tells Cricket that it's to call on the perfmon libraries 
to perform data collection. This is a required field.
<li><tt>host-name</tt> tells Cricket what host name to connect to. In most
cases you'll want to set this to <tt>%auto-target-name%</tt>. This is a
required field.
<li><tt>object name</tt> tells Cricket what object, or class to collect 
sub-classes from. This is something like System, PhysicalDisk, Memory, 
Network Interface, or Server. Using <tt>perfmon.exe</tt> can give you an idea
of what is available on a particular system. While this field isn't required,
you'll want to put something there 99% of the time.
<li><tt>counter name</tt> tells Cricket what counter, or sub-class to collect
counter data from. This is something like % Processor Time, Total Bytes/sec,
or Threads. This is required only if something is in <tt>object name</tt>.
<li><tt>instance name</tt> tells Cricket what instance to fetch from a 
counter. Most counters don't have instances, a few do such as PhysicalDisk,
and Swap. Most instance counters have a '_Total' counter which is a combined
total of all the instances. This is not a required field unless a counter has
instances.
<li><tt>special options</tt> tells Cricket special processing options detailed
later in this document. It takes the following arguments: perftime,
perftime100ns, perffreq, and noscale. Most cases you won't need to use any of
these but some counters require or necessitate them.
<p>
<h2>Collecting Data Part 1</h2>
<p>
There are many types of perfmon counters. They for the most part all require
different calculations to give cooked data from the raw numbers. To help
aid in figuring out what kind of counter is what, there is a program with
cricket in utils called <tt>perfInfo.pl</tt>. For the purpose of this
demonstration, we'll collect on the % Processor Time counter.
<p>
<tt>perfInfo.pl</tt> accepts arguments similar to what Cricket uses for data
collection. You can run <tt>perfInfo.pl -h</tt> to get a list of all the
switches it needs.
<p>
Since we don't know what kind of counter % Processor Time is, we ask 
<tt>perfInfo.pl</tt> to tell us.

Symbols:
TB   Time base. If TB is not used in the calculation, then it indicates the
     units of the raw data.
B    The base value used for calculating performance data types that require
     base.
