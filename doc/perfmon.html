    <h1>The Perfmon Reference Guide</h1>
    <div>
      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        Perfmon in Cricket is a bit tricky to master but ultimately
        worth it if you wish to do long-term performance trending on
        the many useful perfmon counters in NT.
      </p>
      <p>
        One thing which makes it so tricky to use perfmon counters
        is that many of them are "raw" counters which require the
        use of derived, and computed historical data to extract any
        meaning from them. RRDtool makes it easy to perform the
        computations. With a bit of research you can easily discover
        what you need to feed into the Cricket configuration to get
        useful data.

      <h2>Assumptions</h2>
      <p>
        This document assumes the following. You have a working
        Cricket installation, you have some knowledge of Perfmon and
        how it works (run perfmon.exe for a crash course), you're
        attempting to extract data from a box running the
        Windows(tm) operating system, you have some knowledge of RPN
        (Reverse Polish Notation), and finally you feel comfortable
        to make very light modifications to the Cricket code during
        the "discovery process".
      </p>
    </div>

    <div>
      <h2>ds-source Parameters</h2>
      <p>
        Here is a breakdown of what the perfmon ds-source requires
        to operate:
      </p>
      <p>
        <tt>perfmon:host-name:object name:counter name:instance
        name:special options</tt>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <tt>perfmon</tt> tells Cricket that it's to call on the
          perfmon libraries to perform data collection. This is a
          required field.
        </li>
        <li>
          <tt>host-name</tt> tells Cricket what host name to
          connect to. In most cases you'll want to set this to
          <tt>%auto-target-name%</tt>. This is a required
          field.
        </li>
        <li>
          <tt>object name</tt> tells Cricket what object, or class
          to collect sub-classes from. This is something like
          System, PhysicalDisk, Memory, Network Interface, or
          Server. Using <tt>perfmon.exe</tt> can give you an idea
          of what is available on a particular system. While this
          field isn't required, you'll want to put something there
          99% of the time.
        </li>
        <li>
          <tt>counter name</tt> tells Cricket what counter, or
          sub-class to collect counter data from. This is
          something like % Processor Time, Total Bytes/sec, or
          Threads. This is required only if something is in
          <tt>object name</tt>.
        </li>
        <li>
          <tt>instance name</tt> tells Cricket what instance to
          fetch from a counter. Most counters don't have
          instances, a few do such as PhysicalDisk, and Swap. Most
          instance counters have a '_Total' counter which is a
          combined total of all the instances. This is not a
          required field unless a counter has instances.
        </li>
        <li>
          <tt>special options</tt> tells Cricket special
          processing options detailed later in this document. It
          takes the following arguments: perftime, perftime100ns,
          perffreq, and noscale. Most cases you won't need to use
          any of these but some counters require or necessitate
          them.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>

      <h2>Collecting Data Part 1</h2>
      <p>
        There are many types of perfmon counters. They for the most
        part all require different calculations to give cooked data
        from the raw numbers. To help aid in figuring out what kind
        of counter is what, there is a program with cricket in utils
        called <tt>perfInfo.pl</tt>. For the purpose of this
        demonstration, we'll collect on the % Processor Time counter.
      </p>
      <p>
        <tt>perfInfo.pl</tt> accepts arguments similar to what
        Cricket uses for data collection. You can run
        <tt>perfInfo.pl -h</tt> to get a list of all the switches it
        needs.
      </p>
      <p>
        Since we don't know what kind of counter % Processor Time
        is, we ask <tt>perfInfo.pl</tt> to tell us.
      </p>
