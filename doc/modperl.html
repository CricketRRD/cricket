    <h1>Using Cricket with mod_perl</h1>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<code>mod_perl</code>&rdquo; is an Apache module that allows you
      to run Perl scripts inside of Apache without forking a new process for
      each one. This saves lots of time, since Perl only needs to parse the
      script once and can execute it a number of times.
    </p>
    <p>
      As of version 0.68, Cricket can run under &ldquo;<code>mod_perl</code>&rdquo;.
      Typically, no special code needs to be added to scripts to make
      them work in the mod_perl environment, but Cricket's lazy use of
      namespaces required some fix up work. Mea culpa. That work has
      been done now, and going forward, I intend to make sure Cricket
      works under &ldquo;<code>mod_perl</code>&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you'd like to use Cricket under &ldquo;<code>mod_perl</code>&rdquo;,
      you need to first fetch and install Apache with the
      &ldquo;<code>mod_perl</code>&rdquo; module. Cricket has only been tested
      so far with Apache 1.3.6 and &ldquo;<code>mod_perl</code>&rdquo; 1.19.
      The best way to build and install Apache and mod_perl is to fetch both
      packages, uncompress and untar them into one directory, then go into the
      mod_perl directory first and follow the directions in the
      &ldquo;<code>INSTALL.apaci</code>&rdquo; file.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once you have an installation of Apache with
      &ldquo;<code>mod_perl</code>&rdquo; installed, you need to add lines
      like the following to your &ldquo;<code>httpd.conf</code>&rdquo; file:
    </p>
    <div>
      <code class="block">
&lt;Files *.cgi&gt;
  SetHandler perl-script
  PerlHandler Apache::Registry
  Options ExecCGI
&lt;/Files&gt;
      </code>
    </div>
    <p>
      These lines tell your webserver that whenever it sees a file ending in
      &ldquo;<code>.cgi</code>&rdquo;, it should let the embedded Perl
      interpreter run it. This, of course, is problematic if you have some
      &ldquo;<code>.cgi</code>&rdquo; files on your webserver that cannot be
      run by Perl. In that case, you should use a more restrictive
      specification than &ldquo;<code>*.cgi</code>&rdquo; to limit the scope
      of the directives to files in the Cricket user's home directory.
    </p>
    <p>
      There seems to be a bug which causes Apache to fail to find a library
      file in some cases. Confusingly, this tends to happen when it's trying
      to handle a URL that points to an image, resulting in missing images.
      This is strange, since serving up images should not require the Perl
      interpreter. You can fix this by setting the
      &ldquo;<code>PERL5LIB</code>&rdquo; environment variable to the Cricket
      library directory before starting the Apache webserver.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you are going to be editing the library files (i.e. to add a new
      feature), you'll want to definitely add the
      &ldquo;<code>PerlInitHandler Apache::StatINC</code>&rdquo; directive to your config file. This will
      make &ldquo;<code>mod_perl</code>&rdquo; check library timestamps and
      reload them when necessary. You should not run a production server with
      this enabled, since it does some extra work each time a library is used,
      which could be avoided. If you are not using the
      &ldquo;<code>StatINC</code>&rdquo; module, you will need to restart your
      server anytime you change a library file, or else the changes will not
      be picked up.
