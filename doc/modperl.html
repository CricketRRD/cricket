<h1> Using Cricket with mod_perl </h1>

<p>
<tt>mod_perl</tt> is an Apache module that allows you to run
Perl scripts inside of Apache without forking a new process for
each one. This saves lots of time, since Perl only needs to parse
the script once and can execute it a number of times.


<p>
As of version 0.68, Cricket can run under <tt>mod_perl</tt>.
Typically, no special code needs to be added to scripts to make
them work in the mod_perl environment, but Cricket's
lazy use of namespaces required some fixup work. Mea culpa.
That work has been done now, and going forward, I intend
to make sure Cricket works under mod_perl.

<p>
If you'd like to use Cricket under mod_perl, you need to
first fetch and install Apache with the mod_perl module.
Cricket has only been tested so far with Apache 1.3.6 and mod_perl
1.19. The best way to build and install Apache and mod_perl is to
fetch both packages, uncompress and untar them into one directory,
then go into the mod_perl directory first and follow the directions
in the <tt>INSTALL.apaci</tt> file.

<p>
Once you have an installation of Apache with mod_perl installed,
you need to add lines like the following to your httpd.conf file:

<blockquote><pre>
&lt;Files *.cgi&gt;
    SetHandler perl-script
    PerlHandler Apache::Registry
    Options ExecCGI
&lt;/Files&gt;</pre></blockquote>

<p>
These lines tell your webserver that whenever it sees
a file ending in .cgi, it should let the embeded Perl interpreter
run it. This, of course, is problematic if you have some .cgi
files on your webserver that cannot be run by Perl. In that
case, you should use a more restrictive specification
than "*.cgi" to limit the scope of the directives to files
in the Cricket user's home directory.

<p>
There seems to be a bug which causes Apache to fail to find
a library file in some cases. Confusingly, this tends to happen
when it's trying to handle a URL that points to an image, resulting
in missing images. This is strange, since serving up images should
not require the Perl interpreter.
You can fix this by setting the <tt>PERL5LIB</tt>
environment variable to the Cricket library directory before starting
the Apache webserver.

<p>
If you are going to be editing the library files (i.e. to add a new
feature), you'll want to definately add the "PerlInitHandler
Apache::StatINC" directive to your config file. This will make mod_perl
check library timestamps and reload/reparse them when necessary.
You should not run a production server with this enabled, since it
does some extra work each time a library is used, which could be
avoided. If you are not using the StatINC module, you will need to
restart your server anytime you change a library file, or else the
changes will not be picked up.
