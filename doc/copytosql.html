<h1>Using copy-to for Data Warehousing</h1>
<p>
This document assumes the following: you have some knowledge about setting up
databases, you have a database available, and have some sort of administrative
access on it.
<p>
<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>
Until now there has been no good means for data warehousing data from Cricket.
RRD provides a great means for graphing data but sometimes there is a need to
have the numeric values in a more accessible form. That's where the SQL
method for copy-to comes in.
<p>
<h3>Set-Up</h3>
<p>
This is still in it's early stages of development and has only been tested
under SQLServer 7.0. This should definitely work with other versions of
SQLServer, and maybe Sybase. 
<p>
You need to create a database called 'cricket'. In this database, set up a
table called 'CricketData'. There is a file in the docs directory called
<a href="cricket.sql">cricket.sql</a> which can be used either to create the
table, or as a reference to manually create the tables if it won't work with 
your database.
<p>
<h3>Using</h3>
<p>
In a target definition create a copy-to:
<p>
<tt>target myImportantDatasource<br>
	copy-to = "sql:dbi:Sybase:NMSDB,mylogin,mypassword"
</tt>
<p>
As you can see, it's pretty simple to define a copy-to. The
<tt>dbi:Sybase:NMSDB</tt> can be customized to use whatever special definitions
your DBI driver requires. This is designed to be as flexible as possible to
allow for working with all DBI drivers.
<p>
When the collection happens, it inserts into the database whatever numbers 
were retrieved from the target.
<p>
That's it! You now have a crude form of data warehousing set up for Cricket
data.
<p>
<h3>Caveats</h3>
<p>
Yes, there are many.
<p>
<li><b>This isn't guaranteed to work with all DBI platforms</b>. While it's 
designed to be as flexible and generic as possible, it may not work with your 
platform. If it doesn't, we're accepting patches. :)
<li><b>Cooked numbers aren't inserted</b>. This inserts every number into the
database as-is. This means that all of the cool things rrd can do like 
averaging, interpolation, and computations are gone. This copy-to happens
before anything is done with RRD.
<li><b>Datasources aren't named</b>. This is a big limitation right now. It
means that the user has to figure out what datasource number co-responds to
which counter. Luckily, it goes in the order collected in the Defaults file 
for the particular target. Until Cricket can name datasources, it can't insert
named datasources into the database.
<li><b>Cricket doesn't supply any tools for using these numbers</b>. It's up
to you to provide tools for extracting and using the data once it goes to a
database. Cricket is simply an agent for passing the numbers over.
<li><b>Still in early stages of development</b>. Don't expect perfection. As
more people use this, we'll see greater improvements, though.
