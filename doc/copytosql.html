    <h1>Using &ldquo;<code>copy-to</code>&rdquo; for Data Warehousing</h1>
    <p>
      This document assumes the following: you have some knowledge about
      setting up databases, you have a database available, and have some
      sort of administrative access on it. 
    </p>

    <div>
      <h3>Introduction</h3>
      <p>
        Until now there has been no good means for data warehousing
        data from Cricket. RRD provides a great means for graphing
        data but sometimes there is a need to have the numeric values
        in a more accessible form. That's where the SQL method for
        &ldquo;<code>copy-to</code>&rdquo; comes in.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div>
      <h3>Setup</h3>
      <p>
        This is still in it's early stages of development and has only been
        tested under &ldquo;<code>SQLServer 7.0</code>&rdquo;. This should
        definitely work with other versions of
        &ldquo;<code>SQLServer</code>&rdquo;, and maybe
        &ldquo;<code>Sybase</code>&rdquo;.
      </p>
      <p>
        You need to create a database called
        &ldquo;<code>cricket</code>&rdquo;. In this database, set up a table
        called &ldquo;<code>CricketData</code>&rdquo;. There is a file in the
        docs directory called &ldquo;<code><a
        href="cricket.sql">cricket.sql</a></code>&rdquo; which can be used
        either to create the table, or as a reference to manually create the
        tables if it won't work with your database. 
      </p>
    </div>

    <div>
      <h3>Using</h3>
      <p>In a target definition create a &ldquo;<code>copy-to</code>&rdquo;:</p>
      <code class="block">
target myImportantDatasource
  copy-to = "sql:dbi:Sybase:NMSDB,<var>mylogin</var>,<var>mypassword</var>"
      </code>
      <p>
        As you can see, it's pretty simple to define a copy-to. The
        &ldquo;<code>dbi:Sybase:NMSDB</code>&rdquo; can be customized to use
        whatever special definitions your DBI driver requires. This is
        designed to be as flexible as possible to allow for working with all
        DBI drivers.
      </p>
      <p>
        When the collection happens, it inserts into the database
        whatever numbers were retrieved from the target.
      </p>
      <p>
        That's it! You now have a crude form of data warehousing set
        up for Cricket data.
      </p>
    </div>
     
    <div>
      <h3>Caveats</h3>
      <p>Yes, there are many.</p>
      <dl>
        <dt>This isn't guaranteed to work with all DBI platforms.</dt>
        <dd>
          While it's designed to be as flexible and generic as
          possible, it may not work with your platform. If it doesn't,
          we're accepting patches. <code>:-)</code>
        </dd>
        <dt>Cooked numbers aren't inserted.</dt>
        <dd>
          This inserts every number into the database as-is. This means that
          all of the cool things rrd can do like averaging, interpolation, and
          computations are gone. This copy-to happens before anything is done
          with RRD. 
        </dd>
        <dt>Datasources aren't named.</dt>
        <dd>
          This is a big limitation right now. It means that the user has to
          figure out what datasource number co-responds to which counter.
          Luckily, it goes in the order collected in the
          &ldquo;<code>Defaults</code>&rdquo; file for the particular target.
          Until Cricket can name datasources, it can't insert named
          datasources into the database.
          <p class="note">
            Note: Cricket 1.0.4 supports named datasources, but this support
            is pretty new and untested. Until more experience is developed
            with named datasources, this limitation stands.
          </p>
        </dd>
        <dt>Cricket doesn't supply any tools for using these numbers.</dt>
        <dd>
          It's up to you to provide tools for extracting and using the data
          once it goes to a database. Cricket is simply an agent for passing
          the numbers over. 
        </d>
        <dt>Still in early stages of development.</dt>
        <dd>
          Don't expect perfection. As more people use this, we'll see greater
          improvements, though.
