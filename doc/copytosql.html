    <h1>Using copy-to for Data Warehousing</h1>
    <p>
      This document assumes the following: you have some knowledge about
      setting up databases, you have a database available, and have some
      sort of administrative access on it. 
    </p>

    <div>
      <h3>Introduction</h3>
      <p>
        Until now there has been no good means for data warehousing
        data from Cricket. RRD provides a great means for graphing
        data but sometimes there is a need to have the numeric values
        in a more accessible form. That's where the SQL method for
        copy-to comes in.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div>
      <h3>Set-Up</h3>
      <p>
        This is still in it's early stages of development and has only
        been tested under SQLServer 7.0. This should definitely work
        with other versions of SQLServer, and maybe Sybase. 
      </p>
      <p>
        You need to create a database called 'cricket'. In this
        database, set up a table called 'CricketData'. There is a file
        in the docs directory called <a href="cricket.sql">cricket.sql</a>
        which can be used either to create the table, or as a
        reference to manually create the tables if it won't work with
        your database. 
      </p>
    </div>

    <div>
      <h3>Using</h3>
      <p>In a target definition create a copy-to:</p>
      <p><tt>target myImportantDatasource</tt></p>
      <p><tt>copy-to = "sql:dbi:Sybase:NMSDB,mylogin,mypassword"</tt></p>
      <p>
        As you can see, it's pretty simple to define a copy-to. The
        <tt>dbi:Sybase:NMSDB</tt> can be customized to use whatever
        special definitions your DBI driver requires. This is designed
        to be as flexible as possible to allow for working with all
        DBI drivers.
      </p>
      <p>
        When the collection happens, it inserts into the database
        whatever numbers were retrieved from the target. 
      </p>
      <p>
        That's it! You now have a crude form of data warehousing set
        up for Cricket data. 
      </p>

    <div>
      <h3>Caveats</h3>
      <p>Yes, there are many.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>This isn't guaranteed to work with all DBI platforms</b>.
          While it's designed to be as flexible and generic as
          possible, it may not work with your platform. If it doesn't,
          we're accepting patches. :) 
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Cooked numbers aren't inserted</b>. This inserts every
          number into the database as-is. This means that all of the
          cool things rrd can do like averaging, interpolation, and
          computations are gone. This copy-to happens before anything
          is done with RRD. 
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Datasources aren't named</b>. This is a big limitation
          right now. It means that the user has to figure out what
          datasource number co-responds to which counter. Luckily, it
          goes in the order collected in the Defaults file for the
          particular target. Until Cricket can name datasources, it
          can't insert named datasources into the database. 
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Cricket doesn't supply any tools for using these
          numbers</b>. It's up to you to provide tools for extracting
          and using the data once it goes to a database. Cricket is
          simply an agent for passing the numbers over. 
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Still in early stages of development</b>. Don't expect
          perfection. As more people use this, we'll see greater
          improvements, though.
        </li>
