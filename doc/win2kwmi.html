    <title>Installing Cricket on Win2K to Monitor WMI Counters</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Installing Cricket on Win2K to Monitor WMI Counters</h1>
    <p>
      Windows 2000 includes Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI),
      an implementation of the Web-based Enterprise Management (WBEM)
      industry standard. Hardware, operating system, and application
      (such as SQL Server, and IIS) performance data counters are
      available through WMI.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cricket is an open-source software tool originally designed for
      network monitoring and trend analysis on UNIX platforms. The
      source data monitored by Cricket is not restricted to network
      data and it has been successfully applied to monitor hosts and
      applications at WebTV. Cricket is written in Perl, and its
      underlying data storage technology, RRDtool, is available for
      Win32 platforms. Cricket includes a CGI component for monitoring
      access from any web browser.
    </p>
    <p>
      This document describes the process of installing Cricket on
      Windows 2000, running Cricket with Internet Information Server
      (IIS), and using Cricket to collect data from WMI counters. It
      assumes some familiarity with Windows 2000, IIS, WMI, Perl
      Modules, and Cricket.

      <h2>The Materials List</h2>
      <p>
        Deploying Cricket on Windows 2000 to monitor WMI relies on a
        number of Perl packages and some external software.
        Fortunately, these packages and software are all available
        and compatible with Windows 2000. The following is a list of
        the components along with their provider.

    </div>

    <div>
      <h2>Installation Instructions:</h2>
      <p>
        Before you begin, install Windows 2000 Server with IIS. You
        will need Microsoft Visual C++. These instructions assume
        the default configuration for IIS.
      </p>
      <p>
        1. Create a monitoring account in the domain. Give this
        account administrator access on the monitoring machine (the
        machine that will run Cricket). On the remote hosts to be
        monitored, set the proper permissions for the monitoring
        account (this will require the assistance of your domain
        administrator).
      </p>
      <div>
        <p>
          a. On each remote host, the following WMI permissions
          need to granted to the monitoring account for the
          namespace that includes the counters you wish to
          monitor: Execute Methods, Provider Write, Enable
          Account, and Remote Enable (Windows 2000 sets the first
          three to allow by default for Everyone). This can be
          done through scripting, or the WMI Control management
          snap-in (run wmimgmt.msc on a Windows 2000 host).
        </p>
        <p>
          b. WMI permissions are not sufficient alone to access
          some system objects/properties you may wish to monitor
          if these objects/properties are managed through the host
          or domain security policy. On the remote Windows 2000
          computer, use the Local Security Policy control panel
          applet (under Administrative Tools). For example, you
          may need to change the settings on Profile System
          Performance under Local Policies\User Rights Assignment.
        </p>
        <p>
          c. You can use the WMI program, wbemtest.exe (found in
          the %system32%\wbem directory) to confirm permissions
          are set correctly. If step (a) is not completed for a
          host, you will receive an access denied message. If step
          (b) is not completed, WMI queries will seem to work, but
          NULL or zero values will be returned (this can be hard
          to determine because some fields may legitimately be
          NULL or zero).
        </p>
        <p>
          d. If you have security difficulties, one option is to
          make the monitoring account an administrator on each
          remote host it will monitor. But the "right thing to do"
          is for the monitoring account to be a regular domain
          user with just the additional permissions it needs for
          read only access to the WMI counters and objects to be
          monitored.
        </p>
      </div>
      <p>
        2. Login to the monitoring machine using the monitoring account.
      </p>
      <p>
        3. Install Perl from the ActiveState distribution. Notes on
        the ActiveState installer: installing PerlScript and&nbsp;
        Perl for ISAPI is not required. Enable the options
        registering Perl with the Web Server and adding the Perl bin
        directory to your path.
      </p>
      <p>
        4. Install Berkeley DB. Following the instructions included
        with the distribution. Your goal is compile the DLL
        libdb31.dll. Once compiled, make certain this DLL is on your
        path..
      </p>
      <p>
        5. Install Cricket. You may find John Zola's <a
        href="http://cricket.sourceforge.net/support/FAQ/nt_cricket.
        html">Installing Cricket on NT 4.0</a> helpful, although
        many of its specific suggestions are obsolete given the
        cricket-conf.pl configuration scheme introduced with Cricket
        1.0.3.&nbsp; The remainder of the document refers to the
        installation directory as &lt;install dir&gt; (gInstallRoot in
        the code). The cricket subdirectory of &lt;install dir&gt;
        contains the Cricket source code (gConfigRoot in the code).
      </p>
      <div>
        <p>
          a. Set Cricket environment variable settings in
          grapher.cgi, mini-graph.cgi, and cricket-conf.pl.&nbsp;
          In grapher.cgi and mini-grapher.cgi, set programdir
          explicitly. In mini-graph.cgi you may also need to
          replace 'perl' with the complete path to the Perl
          executable (i.e. c:/perl/bin/perl) on the exec() call
          mini-graph.cgi uses to invoke grapher.cgi in the
          doGraph() subroutine. In cricket-conf.pl, set
          gCricketHome. You may also choose to set gConfigRoot and
          gCacheDir. Use forward slashes in pathnames.
        </p>
      </div>
      <p>
        6. Install the additional Perl packages. For Perl extensions
        (a package that includes a compiled DLL), the extension
        build must be compatible with the build of ActiveState
        installed. Currently, ActiveState builds 5xx are Perl 5.005
        and ActiveState builds 6xx are Perl 5.6. The packages
        DB_File, Digest-MD5, and TimeDate are available at the
        ActiveState Perl Package Archive for both 5xx and 6xx
        ActiveState builds. They can be installed via the utility <a
        href="http://aspn.activestate.com/ASPN/Reference/Products/ActivePerl/faq/ActivePerl-faq2.html">ppm</a>. You will need to compile the
        source for the RRDs package after installing ActiveState.
        The source of RRDs is available from <a
        href="http://www.rrdtool.org/">www.rrdtool.org</a>. After
        compilation, manually install this packages to the site/lib
        subtree of your Perl installation. SNMP_Session package does
        not need to be compiled because it does not rely on an
        auxiliary DLL. After you download the archive, extract the
        *.pm files and install them in your site/lib subtree.
      </p>
      <p>
        7. Configure IIS. Start the Internet Services Manager.
      </p>
      <div>
        <p>
          a. Create a virtual directory called crickethome. Set
          the local directory to &lt;install dir&gt;.
        </p>
        <p>
          b. Register *.cgi files to be processed by the Perl
          executable. Right-click properties on the crickethome
          virtual directory. Disable read, write, and directory
          browsing. Set Execute Permissions to "None". Click the
          Configuration button. Look at the settings for the *.pl
          extension. Then create a new Application mapping for
          *.cgi and enter the same information.
        </p>
        <p>
          c. Enable permissions on the cricket subdirectory of
          &lt;install dir&gt; Again, right-click properties. Grant
          read and set Execute Permissions to "Scripts and
          Executables".
        </p>
        <p>d. Stop and restart the Default Web Site.</p>
      </div>
      <p>
        8. Create a scheduled task to run the Cricket script
        collect-subtrees (this the a wrapper script which
        invokes the Cricket collector and performs logging).
      </p>
      <div>
        <p>
          a. Click on Add Scheduled Task under Control
          Panel\Scheduled Tasks. Click through the wizard, choose
          a dummy application, give it the name "Cricket
          Collector", and choose a dummy run schedule. Enter the
          username and password the monitoring account. Enable the
          "Open advanced properties" check box and click Finish.
        </p>
        <p>
          b. Now configure the real task. Enter a command line
          similar to the following (substituting paths on your
          system as appropriate):
        </p>
        <p>c:\Perl\bin\perl &lt;install dir&gt;/cricket/collect-subtrees</p>
        <p>Set the "Start in" field to &lt;install dir&gt;</p>
        <p>
          c. Select the Schedule tab. Schedule the task daily;
          then click the Advanced button. Don't choose an End
          Date. Enable and complete the Repeat task section. Set
          the task to run every 5 minutes (or other interval, this
          should match the <a
          href="reference.html#target">rrd-poll-interval</a> you
          are using). Set the duration to 23 hours and 55 minutes
          (or 24 hours - whatever interval you are using).
        </p>
        <p>d. Back on the Task tab, uncheck the Enabled checkbox.</p>
      </div>
      <p>
        9. Create and compile a Cricket config tree. Configure the
        subtree-sets file (in &lt;install dir&gt;\cricket). Refer to <a
        href="reference.html">Cricket documentation</a> and the next
        section on this document, <a href="#wbemodbc">Monitoring WMI
        Counters</a>. After successful compilation, you may choose
        to run the collector manually to check for any errors.
      </p>
      <p>10. Enable the scheduled task you created in step (8).</p>
      <p>
        11. After a few minutes, check log files in &lt;install
        dir&gt;/cricket-logs to verify everything is running okay. Test
        the grapher on the monitoring machine with the URL: <a
        href="http://localhost/crickethome/cricket/grapher.cgi">http://localhost/crickethome/cricket/grapher.cgi</a>
      </p>
    </div>

    <div>
      <h2><a name="wbemodbc"></a>Monitoring WMI Counters</h2>
      <p>
        Polling WMI counters is facilitated through the fetch
        module, wbem.pm. This diagram illustrates the layers of the
        data collection mechanism:
      </p>
      <p><img src="win2kw1.gif" height="261" width="363" alt="" /></p>
      <p>
        As described in the Cricket documentation, each data
        collection mechanism has a scheme, which describes a mapping
        between the ds-source tag of the data source dictionary
        entry and the list of arguments passed to the fetch module.
        For WBEM, the scheme is:
      </p>
      <pre>wbem:host:namespace:class:field:predicate</pre>
      <p>
        The arguments host and namespace are used to establish a
        connection to either the local or a remote machine. The
        arguments class, field, and predicate are use to construct a
        WQL query.
      </p>
      <p>
        No username and password are specified for remote queries.
        The DCOM layer automatically substitutes the username and
        password of the monitoring account when a connection is
        established to a remote machine.
      </p>
      <p>
        Host is a Win2K host name. Host should be blank or
        unspecified for the local machine.
      </p>
      <p>
        Namespace refers to the WMI namespace to be queried. Most of
        the interesting WMI classes are under Root\CIMV2.
        Backslashes in the namespace specification must be escaped.
      </p>
      <p>
        WQL is a language very similar to SQL for querying WMI
        classes. A WMI class can be thought of as a table, with one
        or more records, or instances. The attributes of the class
        are the table fields. Conceptually, the class, field, and
        predicate for a WBEM data source generate the query:
      </p>
      <pre>Select field from class where predicate</pre>
      <p>
        If the class of interest has only once instance, then the
        predicate argument can be omitted. If the class has multiple
        instances, you should specific a predicate to restrict the
        result to a single instance. Although Cricket supports
        multiple instances for SNMP data sources, this is not the
        case for WBEM data sources. Each data source must be mapped
        to exactly one WMI instance; in other words, each WQL query
        must be a singleton select.
      </p>
      <p>
        Similar to the Cricket SNMP fetch modules, wbem.pm
        consolidates multiple requests to the same remote host and
        the same WMI class (table) as long as the data sources are
        within the same target (RRD file). Separate targets
        requiring remote connections to the same host will result in
        separate connections.
      </p>
      <p>
        For example, suppose you wish to monitor both the
        ReadOperationCount and WriteOperationCount for some
        Win32_Process on the same machine. Here are the two
        ds-source entries:
      </p>
      <pre>
wbem:host:Root\\CIMV2:Win32_Process:ReadOperationCount:Name='process.exe'
wbem:host:Root\\CIMV2:Win32_Process:WriteOperationCount:Name='process.exe'
      </pre>
      <p>
        If these data source are in the same target, wbem.pm will
        establish a single connection to host as username and issue
        the WQL query:
      </p>
      <pre>
Select "ReadOperationCount", "WriteOperationCount" from "Win32_Process" where Name = 'process.exe'
      </pre>
      <p>
        If you are uncertain as to what can be monitored via WMI,
        you can use the WMI Object Browser included with the WMI
        SDK. You can test the semantics and syntax of WQL queries
        through wbemtest.exe, a utility included on all Win2K
        systems.
