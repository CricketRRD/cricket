		<title>Installing Cricket on Win2K to Monitor WMI Counters</title>
	</head>
	<body>
		<h1>Installing Cricket on Win2K to Monitor WMI Counters</h1>
		<p>
			Windows 2000 includes Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI),
			an implementation of the Web-based Enterprise Management (WBEM)
			industry standard. Hardware, operating system, and application
			(such as SQL Server, and IIS) performance data counters are
			available through WMI.
		</p>
		<p>
			Cricket is an open-source software tool originally designed for
			network monitoring and trend analysis on UNIX platforms. The
			source data monitored by Cricket is not restricted to network
			data and it has been successfully applied to monitor hosts and
			applications at WebTV. Cricket is written in Perl, and its
			underlying data storage technology, RRDtool, is available for
			Win32 platforms. Cricket includes a CGI component for monitoring
			access from any web browser.
		</p>
		<p>
			This document describes the process of installing Cricket on
			Windows 2000, running Cricket with Internet Information Server
			(IIS), and using Cricket to collect data from WMI counters. It
			assumes some familiarity with Windows 2000, IIS, WMI, Perl
			Modules, and Cricket.

			You may wish to review John Zola's document <a
			href="http://cricket.sourceforge.net/support/FAQ/nt_cricket.html
			">Installing Cricket on NT 4.0</a>. He discusses some of the
			details omitted from this document (such as compiling RRDs).

			<h2>The Materials List</h2>
			<p>
				Deploying Cricket on Windows 2000 to monitor WMI relies on a
				number of Perl packages and some external software.
				Fortunately, these packages and software are all available
				and compatible with Windows 2000. The following is a list of
				the components along with their provider.

				</li>
			</ul>

			<h2>Installation Instructions:</h2>
			<p>
				Before you begin, install Windows 2000 Server with IIS. You
				will need Microsoft Visual C++. These instructions assume
				the default configuration for IIS.
			</p>
			<p>
				1. Create a monitoring account in the domain. Give this
				account administrator access on the monitoring machine (the
				machine that will run Cricket). On the remote hosts to be
				monitored, set the proper permissions for the monitoring
				account (this will require the assistance of your domain
				administrator).
			</p>
			<div>
				<p>
					a. On each remote host, the following WMI permissions
					need to granted to the monitoring account for the
					namespace that includes the counters you wish to
					monitor: Execute Methods, Provider Write, Enable
					Account, and Remote Enable (Windows 2000 sets the first
					three to allow by default for Everyone). This can be
					done through scripting, or the WMI Control management
					snap-in (run wmimgmt.msc on a Windows 2000 host).
				</p>
				<p>
					b. WMI permissions are not sufficient alone to access
					some system objects/properties you may wish to monitor
					if these objects/properties are managed through the host
					or domain security policy. On the remote Windows 2000
					computer, use the Local Security Policy control panel
					applet (under Administrative Tools). For example, you
					may need to change the settings on Profile System
					Performance under Local Policies\User Rights Assignment.
				</p>
				<p>
					c. You can use the WMI program, wbemtest.exe (found in
					the %system32%\wbem directory) to confirm permissions
					are set correctly. If step (a) is not completed for a
					host, you will receive an access denied message. If step
					(b) is not completed, WMI queries will seem to work, but
					NULL or zero values will be returned (this can be hard
					to determine because some fields may legitimately be
					NULL or zero).
				</p>
				<p>
					d. If you have security difficulties, one option is to
					make the monitoring account an administrator on each
					remote host it will monitor. But the "right thing to do"
					is for the monitoring account to be a regular domain
					user with just the additional permissions it needs for
					read only access to the WMI counters and objects to be
					monitored.
				</p>
			</div>
			<p>
				2. Login to the monitoring machine using the monitoring account.
			</p>
			<p>
				3. Install Perl from the ActiveState distribution. Notes on
				the ActiveState installer: installing PerlScript and&nbsp;
				Perl for ISAPI is not required. Enable the options
				registering Perl with the Web Server and adding the Perl bin
				directory to your path.
			</p>
			<p>
				4. Install Berkeley DB. Following the instructions included
				with the distribution. Your goal is compile the DLL
				libdb31.dll. Once compiled, make certain this DLL is on your
				path..
			</p>
			<p>
				5. Install Cricket. You may find John Zola's <a
				href="http://cricket.sourceforge.net/support/FAQ/nt_cricket.
				html">Installing Cricket on NT 4.0</a> helpful, although
				many of its specific suggestions are obsolete given the
				cricket-conf.pl configuration scheme introduced with Cricket
				1.0.3.&nbsp; The remainder of the document refers to the
				installation directory as &lt;install dir&gt; (gInstallRoot in
				the code). The cricket subdirectory of &lt;install dir&gt;
				contains the Cricket source code (gConfigRoot in the code).
			</p>
			<div>
				<p>
					a. Set Cricket environment variable settings in
					grapher.cgi, mini-graph.cgi, and cricket-conf.pl.&nbsp;
					In grapher.cgi and mini-grapher.cgi, set programdir
					explicitly. In mini-graph.cgi you may also need to
					replace 'perl' with the complete path to the Perl
					executable (i.e. c:/perl/bin/perl) on the exec() call
					mini-graph.cgi uses to invoke grapher.cgi in the
					doGraph() subroutine. In cricket-conf.pl, set
					gCricketHome. You may also choose to set gConfigRoot and
					gCacheDir. Use forward slashes in pathnames.
				</p>
			</div>
			<p>
				6. Install the additional Perl packages. For Perl extensions
				(a package that includes a compiled DLL), the extension
				build must be compatible with the build of ActiveState
				installed. Currently, ActiveState builds 5xx are Perl 5.005
				and ActiveState builds 6xx are Perl 5.6. The packages
				DB_File, Digest-MD5, and TimeDate are available at the
				ActiveState Perl Package Archive for both 5xx and 6xx
				ActiveState builds. They can be installed via the utility <a
				href="http://aspn.activestate.com/ASPN/Reference/Products/ActivePerl/faq/ActivePerl-faq2.html">ppm</a>. You will need to compile the
				source for the RRDs package after installing ActiveState.
				The source of RRDs is available from <a
				href="http://www.rrdtool.org/">www.rrdtool.org</a>. After
				compilation, manually install this packages to the site/lib
				subtree of your Perl installation. SNMP_Session package does
				not need to be compiled because it does not rely on an
				auxiliary DLL. After you download the archive, extract the
				*.pm files and install them in your site/lib subtree.
			</p>
			<p>
				7. Configure IIS. Start the Internet Services Manager.
			</p>
			<div>
				<p>
					a. Create a virtual directory called crickethome. Set
					the local directory to &lt;install dir&gt;.
				</p>
				<p>
					b. Register *.cgi files to be processed by the Perl
					executable. Right-click properties on the crickethome
					virtual directory. Disable read, write, and directory
					browsing. Set Execute Permissions to "None". Click the
					Configuration button. Look at the settings for the *.pl
					extension. Then create a new Application mapping for
					*.cgi and enter the same information.
				</p>
				<p>
					c. Enable permissions on the cricket subdirectory of
					&lt;install dir&gt; Again, right-click properties. Grant
					read and set Execute Permissions to "Scripts and
					Executables".
				</p>
				<p>d. Stop and restart the Default Web Site.</p>
			</div>
			<p>
				8. Create a scheduled task to run the Cricket script
				collect-subtrees (this the a wrapper script which
				invokes the Cricket collector and performs logging).
			</p>
			<div>
				<p>
					a. Click on Add Scheduled Task under Control
					Panel\Scheduled Tasks. Click through the wizard, choose
					a dummy application, give it the name "Cricket
					Collector", and choose a dummy run schedule. Enter the
					username and password the monitoring account. Enable the
					"Open advanced properties" check box and click Finish.
				</p>
				<p>
					b. Now configure the real task. Enter a command line
					similar to the following (substituting paths on your
					system as appropriate):
				</p>
				<p>c:\Perl\bin\perl &lt;install dir&gt;/cricket/collect-subtrees</p>
				<p>Set the "Start in" field to &lt;install dir&gt;</p>
				<p>
					c. Select the Schedule tab. Schedule the task daily;
					then click the Advanced button. Don't choose an End
					Date. Enable and complete the Repeat task section. Set
					the task to run every 5 minutes (or other interval, this
					should match the <a
					href="reference.html#target">rrd-poll-interval</a> you
					are using). Set the duration to 23 hours and 55 minutes
					(or 24 hours - whatever interval you are using).
				</p>
				<p>d. Back on the Task tab, uncheck the Enabled checkbox.</p>
			</div>
			<p>
				9. Create and compile a Cricket config tree. Configure the
				subtree-sets file (in &lt;install dir&gt;\cricket). Refer to <a
				href="reference.html">Cricket documentation</a> and the next
				section on this document, <a href="#wbemodbc">Monitoring WMI
				Counters</a>. After successful compilation, you may choose
				to run the collector manually to check for any errors.
			</p>
			<p>10. Enable the scheduled task you created in step (8).</p>
			<p>
				11. After a few minutes, check log files in &lt;install
				dir&gt;/cricket-logs to verify everything is running okay. Test
				the grapher on the monitoring machine with the URL: <a
				href="http://localhost/crickethome/cricket/grapher.cgi">http://localhost/crickethome/cricket/grapher.cgi</a>
			</p>
		</div>

			<h2><a name="wbemodbc"></a>Monitoring WMI Counters</h2>
			<p>
				Polling WMI counters is facilitated through the fetch
				module, wbem.pm. This diagram illustrates the layers of the
				data collection mechanism:
			</p>
			<p><img src="win2kw1.gif" height="261" width="363" alt="" /></p>
			<p>
				As described in the Cricket documentation, each data
				collection mechanism has a scheme, which describes a mapping
				between the ds-source tag of the data source dictionary
				entry and the list of arguments passed to the fetch module.
				For WBEM, the scheme is:
			</p>
			<pre>wbem:host:namespace:class:field:predicate</pre>
			<p>
				The arguments host and namespace are used to establish a
				connection to either the local or a remote machine. The
				arguments class, field, and predicate are use to construct a
				WQL query.
			</p>
			<p>
				No username and password are specified for remote queries.
				The DCOM layer automatically substitutes the username and
				password of the monitoring account when a connection is
				established to a remote machine.
			</p>
			<p>
				Host is a Win2K host name. Host should be blank or
				unspecified for the local machine.
			</p>
			<p>
				Namespace refers to the WMI namespace to be queried. Most of
				the interesting WMI classes are under Root\CIMV2.
				Backslashes in the namespace specification must be escaped.
			</p>
			<p>
				WQL is a language very similar to SQL for querying WMI
				classes. A WMI class can be thought of as a table, with one
				or more records, or instances. The attributes of the class
				are the table fields. Conceptually, the class, field, and
				predicate for a WBEM data source generate the query:
			</p>
			<pre>Select field from class where predicate</pre>
			<p>
				If the class of interest has only once instance, then the
				predicate argument can be omitted. If the class has multiple
				instances, you should specific a predicate to restrict the
				result to a single instance. Although Cricket supports
				multiple instances for SNMP data sources, this is not the
				case for WBEM data sources. Each data source must be mapped
				to exactly one WMI instance; in other words, each WQL query
				must be a singleton select.
			</p>
			<p>
				Similar to the Cricket SNMP fetch modules, wbem.pm
				consolidates multiple requests to the same remote host and
				the same WMI class (table) as long as the data sources are
				within the same target (RRD file). Separate targets
				requiring remote connections to the same host will result in
				separate connections.
			</p>
			<p>
				For example, suppose you wish to monitor both the
				ReadOperationCount and WriteOperationCount for some
				Win32_Process on the same machine. Here are the two
				ds-source entries:
			</p>
			<pre>
wbem:host:Root\\CIMV2:Win32_Process:ReadOperationCount:Name='process.exe'
wbem:host:Root\\CIMV2:Win32_Process:WriteOperationCount:Name='process.exe'
			</pre>
			<p>
				If these data source are in the same target, wbem.pm will
				establish a single connection to host as username and issue
				the WQL query:
			</p>
			<pre>
Select "ReadOperationCount", "WriteOperationCount" from "Win32_Process" where Name = 'process.exe'
			</pre>
			<p>
				If you are uncertain as to what can be monitored via WMI,
				you can use the WMI Object Browser included with the WMI
				SDK. You can test the semantics and syntax of WQL queries
				through wbemtest.exe, a utility included on all Win2K
				systems.
