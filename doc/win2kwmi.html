<h1>
Installing Cricket on Win2K to Monitor WMI Counters</h1>
Draft 4: Aug 8, 2001
<p>Windows 2000 includes Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI), an implementation
of the Web-based Enterprise Management (WBEM) industry standard. Hardware,
operating system, and application (such as SQL Server, and IIS) performance
data counters are available through WMI.
<p>Cricket is an open-source software tool originally designed for network
monitoring and trend analysis on UNIX platforms. The source data monitored
by Cricket is not restricted to network data and it has been successfully
applied to monitor hosts and applications at WebTV. Cricket is written
in Perl, and its underlying data storage technology, RRDtool, is available
for Win32 platforms. Cricket includes a CGI component for monitoring access
from any web browser.
<p>This document describes the process of installing Cricket on Windows
2000, running Cricket with Internet Information Server (IIS), and using
Cricket to collect data from WMI counters. It assumes some familiarity
with Windows 2000, IIS, WMI, Perl Modules, and Cricket.
<p>You may wish to review John Zola's document <a href="http://cricket.sourceforge.net/support/FAQ/nt_cricket.html">Installing
Cricket on NT 4.0</a>. He discusses some of the details omitted from this
document (such as compiling RRDs).
<h2>
The Materials List</h2>
Deploying Cricket on Windows 2000 to monitor WMI relies on a number of
Perl packages and some external software. Fortunately, these packages and
software are all available and compatible with Windows 2000. The following
is a list of the components along with their provider.

<h2>
Installation Instructions:</h2>
Before you begin, install Windows 2000 Server with IIS. You will need Microsoft
Visual C++. These instructions assume the default configuration for IIS.

<p style="margin-left:.25in;text-indent:-.25in;mso-list:l4 level1 lfo5;
tab-stops:list .25in">1.
Create a monitoring account in the domain. Give this account administrator
access on the monitoring machine (the machine that will run Cricket). On
the remote hosts to be monitored, set the proper permissions for the monitoring
account (this will require the assistance of your domain administrator).

<p style="margin-left:1.0in;text-indent:-.25in;mso-list:l4 level2 lfo5;
tab-stops:list 1.0in">a.
On each remote host, the following WMI permissions need to granted to the
monitoring account for the namespace that includes the counters you wish
to monitor: Execute Methods, Provider Write, Enable Account, and Remote
Enable (Windows 2000 sets the first three to allow by default for Everyone).
This can be done through scripting, or the WMI Control management snap-in
(run wmimgmt.msc on a Windows 2000 host).

<p style="margin-left:1.0in;text-indent:-.25in;mso-list:l4 level2 lfo5;
tab-stops:list 1.0in">b.
WMI permissions are not sufficient alone to access some system objects/properties
you may wish to monitor if these objects/properties are managed through
the host or domain security policy. On the remote Windows 2000 computer,
use the Local Security Policy control panel applet (under Administrative
Tools). For example, you may need to change the settings on Profile System
Performance under Local Policies\User Rights Assignment.

<p style="margin-left:1.0in;text-indent:-.25in;mso-list:l4 level2 lfo5;
tab-stops:list 1.0in">c.
You can use the WMI program, wbemtest.exe (found in the %system32%\wbem
directory) to confirm permissions are set correctly. If step (a) is not
completed for a host, you will receive an access denied message. If step
(b) is not completed, WMI queries will seem to work, but NULL or zero values
will be returned (this can be hard to determine because some fields may
legitimately be NULL or zero).

<p style="margin-left:1.0in;text-indent:-.25in;mso-list:l4 level2 lfo5;
tab-stops:list 1.0in">d.
If you have security difficulties, one option is to make the monitoring
account an administrator on each remote host it will monitor. But the "right
thing to do" is for the monitoring account to be a regular domain user
with just the additional permissions it needs for read only access to the
WMI counters and objects to be monitored.

<p style="margin-left:.25in;text-indent:-.25in;mso-list:l4 level1 lfo5;
tab-stops:list .25in">2.
Login to the monitoring machine using the monitoring account.

<p style="margin-left:.25in;text-indent:-.25in;mso-list:l4 level1 lfo5;
tab-stops:list .25in">3.
Install Perl from the ActiveState distribution. Notes on the ActiveState
installer: installing PerlScript and&nbsp; Perl for ISAPI is not required.
Enable the options registering Perl with the Web Server and adding the
Perl bin directory to your path.

<p style="margin-left:.25in;text-indent:-.25in;mso-list:l4 level1 lfo5;
tab-stops:list .25in">4.
Install Berkeley DB. Following the instructions included with the distribution.
Your goal is compile the DLL libdb31.dll. Once compiled, make certain this
DLL is on your path..

<p style="margin-left:.25in;text-indent:-.25in;mso-list:l4 level1 lfo5;
tab-stops:list .25in">5.
Install Cricket. You may find John Zola's <a href="http://cricket.sourceforge.net/support/FAQ/nt_cricket.html">Installing
Cricket on NT 4.0</a> helpful, although many of its specific suggestions
are obsolete given the cricket-conf.pl configuration scheme introduced
with Cricket 1.0.3.&nbsp; The remainder of the document refers to the installation
directory as &lt;install dir> (gInstallRoot in the code). The cricket subdirectory
of &lt;install dir> contains the Cricket source code (gConfigRoot in the
code).

<p style="margin-left:1.0in;text-indent:-.25in;mso-list:l4 level2 lfo5;
tab-stops:list 1.0in">a.&nbsp;
Set Cricket environment variable settings in grapher.cgi, mini-graph.cgi,
and cricket-conf.pl.&nbsp; In grapher.cgi and mini-grapher.cgi, set programdir 
explicitly. In mini-graph.cgi you may also need to replace 'perl' with
the complete path to the Perl executable (i.e. c:/perl/bin/perl) on the
exec() call mini-graph.cgi uses to invoke grapher.cgi in the doGraph()
subroutine. In cricket-conf.pl, set gCricketHome. You may also choose to
set gConfigRoot and gCacheDir. Use forward slashes in pathnames.

<p style="margin-left:.25in;text-indent:-.25in;mso-list:l4 level1 lfo5;
tab-stops:list .25in">6.
Install the additional Perl packages. For Perl extensions (a package that
includes a compiled DLL), the extension build must be compatible with the
build of ActiveState installed. Currently, ActiveState builds 5xx are Perl
5.005 and ActiveState builds 6xx are Perl 5.6. The packages DB_File, Digest-MD5,
and TimeDate are available at the ActiveState Perl Package Archive for
both 5xx and 6xx ActiveState builds. They can be installed via the utility
<a href="http://velocity.activestate.com/docs/ActivePerl/faq/ActivePerl-faq2.html">ppm</a>.
You will need to compile the source for the RRDs package after installing
ActiveState. The source of RRDs is available from <a href="http://www.rrdtool.org/">www.rrdtool.org</a>.
After compilation, manually install this packages to the site/lib subtree
of your Perl installation. SNMP_Session package does not need to be compiled
because it does not rely on an auxiliary DLL. After you download the archive,
extract the *.pm files and install them in your site/lib subtree.

<p style="margin-left:.25in;text-indent:-.25in;mso-list:l4 level1 lfo5;
tab-stops:list .25in">7.
Configure IIS. Start the Internet Services Manager.

<p style="margin-left:1.0in;text-indent:-.25in;mso-list:l4 level2 lfo5;
tab-stops:list 1.0in">a.
Create a virtual directory called crickethome. Set the local directory
to &lt;install dir>.

<p style="margin-left:1.0in;text-indent:-.25in;mso-list:l4 level2 lfo5;
tab-stops:list 1.0in">b.
Register *.cgi files to be processed by the Perl executable. Right-click
properties on the crickethome virtual directory. Disable read, write, and
directory browsing. Set Execute Permissions to "None". Click the Configuration
button. Look at the settings for the *.pl extension. Then create a new
Application mapping for *.cgi and enter the same information.

<p style="margin-left:1.0in;text-indent:-.25in;mso-list:l4 level2 lfo5;
tab-stops:list 1.0in">c.
Enable permissions on the cricket subdirectory of &lt;install dir>. Again,
right-click properties. Grant read and set Execute Permissions to "Scripts
and Executables".

<p style="margin-left:1.0in;text-indent:-.25in;mso-list:l4 level2 lfo5;
tab-stops:list 1.0in">d.
Stop and restart the Default Web Site.

<p style="margin-left:.25in;text-indent:-.25in;mso-list:l4 level1 lfo5;
tab-stops:list .25in">8.
Create a scheduled task to run the Cricket script collect-subtrees (this
the a wrapper script which invokes the Cricket collector and performs logging).

<p style="margin-left:1.0in;text-indent:-.25in;mso-list:l4 level2 lfo5;
tab-stops:list 1.0in">a.
Click on Add Scheduled Task under Control Panel\Scheduled Tasks. Click
through the wizard, choose a dummy application, give it the name "Cricket
Collector", and choose a dummy run schedule. Enter the username and password
the monitoring account. Enable the "Open advanced properties" check box
and click Finish.

<p style="margin-left:1.0in;text-indent:-.25in;mso-list:l4 level2 lfo5;
tab-stops:list 1.0in">b.
Now configure the real task. Enter a command line similar to the following
(substituting paths on your system as appropriate):

<p style="margin-left:.75in">c:\Perl\bin\perl &lt;install dir>/cricket/collect-subtrees

<p style="margin-left:.75in">Set the "Start in" field to &lt;install dir>

<p style="margin-left:1.0in;text-indent:-.25in;mso-list:l4 level2 lfo5;
tab-stops:list 1.0in">c.
Select the Schedule tab. Schedule the task daily; then click the Advanced
button. Don't choose an End Date. Enable and complete the Repeat task section.
Set the task to run every 5 minutes (or other interval, this should match
the <a href="reference.html#target">rrd-poll-interval</a> you are using).
Set the duration to 23 hours and 55 minutes (or 24 hours - whatever interval
you are using).

<p style="margin-left:1.0in;text-indent:-.25in;mso-list:l4 level2 lfo5;
tab-stops:list 1.0in">d.
Back on the Task tab, uncheck the Enabled checkbox.

<p style="margin-left:.25in;text-indent:-.25in;mso-list:l4 level1 lfo5;
tab-stops:list .25in">9.
Create and compile a Cricket config tree. Configure the subtree-sets file
(in &lt;install dir>\cricket). Refer to <a href="reference.html">Cricket
documentation</a> and the next section on this document, <a href="#wbemodbc">Monitoring
WMI Counters</a>. After successful compilation, you may choose to run the
collector manually to check for any errors.

<p style="margin-left:.25in;text-indent:-.25in;mso-list:l4 level1 lfo5;
tab-stops:list .25in">10.
Enable the scheduled task you created in step (8).

<p style="margin-left:.25in;text-indent:-.25in;mso-list:l4 level1 lfo5;
tab-stops:list .25in">11.
After a few minutes, check log files in &lt;install dir>/cricket-logs to
verify everything is running okay. Test the grapher on the monitoring machine
with the URL: <a href="http://localhost/crickethome/cricket/grapher.cgi">http://localhost/crickethome/cricket/grapher.cgi</a>
<h2>
<a NAME="wbemodbc"></a>Monitoring WMI Counters</h2>
Polling WMI counters is facilitated through the fetch module, wbem.pm.
This diagram illustrates the layers of the data collection mechanism:
<p><img SRC="win2kw1.gif" BORDER=0 height=261 width=363>
<p>As described in the Cricket documentation, each data collection mechanism
has a scheme, which describes a mapping between the ds-source tag of the
data source dictionary entry and the list of arguments passed to the fetch
module. For WBEM, the scheme is:
<pre>wbem:host:namespace:class:field:predicate</pre>

<div class="MsoNormal">The arguments host and namespace are used to establish
a connection to either the local or a remote machine. The arguments class,
field, and predicate are use to construct a WQL query.</div>


<p class="MsoNormal">No username and password are specified for remote
queries. The DCOM layer automatically substitutes the username and password
of the monitoring account when a connection is established to a remote
machine.

<p class="MsoNormal">Host is a Win2K host name. Host should be blank or
unspecified for the local machine.

<p class="MsoNormal">Namespace refers to the WMI namespace to be queried.
Most of the interesting WMI classes are under Root\CIMV2. Backslashes in
the namespace specification must be escaped.

<p class="MsoNormal">WQL is a language very similar to SQL for querying
WMI classes. A WMI class can be thought of as a table, with one or more
records, or instances. The attributes of the class are the table fields.
Conceptually, the class, field, and predicate for a WBEM data source generate
the query:
<pre>Select field from class where predicate</pre>

<div class="MsoNormal">If the class of interest has only once instance,
then the predicate argument can be omitted. If the class has multiple instances,
you should specific a predicate to restrict the result to a single instance.
Although Cricket supports multiple instances for SNMP data sources, this
is not the case for WBEM data sources. Each data source must be mapped
to exactly one WMI instance; in other words, each WQL query must be a singleton
select.</div>


<p class="MsoNormal">Similar to the Cricket SNMP fetch modules, wbem.pm
consolidates multiple requests to the same remote host and the same WMI
class (table) as long as the data sources are within the same target (RRD
file). Separate targets requiring remote connections to the same host will
result in separate connections.
<br>For example, suppose you wish to monitor both the ReadOperationCount
and WriteOperationCount for some Win32_Process on the same machine. Here
are the two ds-source entries:
<pre>wbem:host:Root\\CIMV2:Win32_Process:ReadOperationCount:Name='process.exe'
wbem:host:Root\\CIMV2:Win32_Process:WriteOperationCount:Name='process.exe'</pre>
If these data source are in the same target, wbem.pm will establish a single
connection to host as username and issue the WQL query:
<pre>Select "ReadOperationCount", "WriteOperationCount" from "Win32_Process" where Name = 'process.exe'</pre>
If you are uncertain as to what can be monitored via WMI, you can use the
WMI Object Browser included with the WMI SDK. You can test the semantics
and syntax of WQL queries through wbemtest.exe, a utility included on all
Win2K systems.
