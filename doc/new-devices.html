		<h1>Setting up New Devices in Cricket</h1>
		<p>
			Cricket is designed to be flexible enough to be able to monitor
			more than just router interfaces. The sample config tree that
			comes with it will help you learn about its capabilities, but to
			monitor other things, you'll need to write your own branches of
			the config tree.
		</p>
		<p>
			Read this document to learn how to get the most from Cricket, by
			teaching it to gather data from all kinds of sources.
		</p>

			<h2>Creating Custom Target Types</h2>
			<p>
				Cricket gives you complete control over the contents and
				layout of your RRD files. This means that if you are going
				to be doing any serious target-type hacking, you need to
				understand the following concepts:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Round Robin Array (RRA)
					<p>
						This is where data is stored in an RRD. There is one
						RRA for each scale of data, for example 5 minute
						samples, 30 minute samples, and 2 hour samples. The
						same data is in each RRA, except it is sampled at a
						different rate. If an RRA can hold 12 samples and it
						is updated every 5 minutes, then it holds data
						spanning back one hour. The 13th sample will
						overwrite the 1st sample.  Detailed information
						about RRD is available from <a
						href="http://ee-staff.ethz.ch/~oetiker/webtools/
						rrdtool/manual/index.html">the RRD Tool
						documentation</a> and from the <a
						href="http://ee-staff.ethz.ch/~oetiker/webtools/
						rrdtool/tutorial">RRD Tool tutorials</a>.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>Data Source
					<p>
						A data source is one line on a graph, or one column
						of data if you think of the RRD as a tabular listing
						of data. One RRD can have many datasources in it.
						All up them must be updated with new data at once.
						Not all of them need to be graphed at once (see the
						information about datasource "views" below).
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>Target
					<p>
						A device that we are keeping stats on is a target.
						There one RRD file on disk for every target. You can
						think of each target as a leaf on the config tree.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>Target Type
					<p>
						The type of the target determines what kinds of data
						sources and RRA's makes up the target. When Cricket
						goes to update a target, it uses the target type to
						figure out what data to fetch about the target, and
						how to fetch it.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>Data Source Source (ds-source)
					<p>
						This is the rather unfortunate name for the
						attribute of a data source that tells Cricket
						precisely where to fetch the data from, and which
						data to fetch. Encoded in the ds-source is the
						retrieval method and a description of the data we
						want.
					</p>
				</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				Now, with all those terms under your belt, you'll understand
				this statement: Using the datasource, RRA, and targetType
				dictionaries, you can completely control the kind, source,
				and quantity of data you store. The RRA's in the
				sample-config reproduce <a href="http://www.mrtg.org/">MRTG
				2.x's</a> data format precisely, and that configuration has
				proven to work well for most needs. If you are going to be
				using Cricket for the jobs it comes ready to do, you'll
				simply need to copy the sample-config tree and make minor
				changes to the targets it specifies.
			</p>
			<p>
				If you need to customize Cricket to talk to other things,
				then you'll be following the following general steps:
			</p>
			<ol>
				<li>
					Create entries in the datasource dictionary that tell
					Cricket how to fetch your new measurement. If you are
					using SNMP, you'll probably want to add an entry to the
					OID dictionary in the same subtree, to make your
					datasource entry readable. For instance, say we wanted
					to use Cricket to talk via SNMP to an agent running on a
					Unix machine, and fetch the load average. We would add
					the OID for the load average to the OID table, then add
					a new entry (named "load-average") to the datasource
					dictionary that described this new datasource.
				</li>
				<li>
					Create a targetType entry to tell Cricket what
					datasources make up your new target-type. Assuming the
					RRA definitions from the <tt>--default--</tt> entry are
					right, you only need to add set the "ds" tag for this
					entry. For the load average example, we'd put
					"ds=load-average" into a targetType entry named
					"unix-machine".
				</li>
				<li>
					Create a new target who's target-type tag is set to the
					targetType you created in the last step. If you are
					using SNMP to talk to the host, you need to make certain
					the variable snmp-host is set (since it contributes to
					the snmp variable, which in turn is required in SNMP
					ds-sources). You could set the snmp-host tag explicitly
					for every tag, but that would be a pain. Instead, you
					could choose your target names to be hostnames, then use
					the auto-target-name to set snmp-host correctly all the
					time, by adding a line like snmp-host =
					%auto-target-name% to the --default-- entry for that
					sub-tree. If you have a rare case in your system where
					the target name is not the name you want to send SNMP
					packets to, then you could override the default
					snmp-host by setting snmp-host directly for that one
					target.
				</li>
				<li>
					Run the collector on your new subtree, using the
					"-loglevel debug" option. This will tell you exactly
					what Cricket thinks things are set to when it tries to
					fetch your data, as well as what exactly happened when
					it went to fetch the data
				</li>
			</ol>
			<p>
				If you come up with an interesting configuration, please
				share it with the Cricket community by submitting it to the
				<a
				href="http://www.gnac.com/techinfo/cricket_contrib/index.
				html">Cricket contrib site</a> hosted by the nice folks at
				<a href="http://www.gnac.com">GNAC</a>.
			</p>
			<p>
				If you need to add a new kind of data gathering subroutine,
				you'll want to read the code to <tt>snmp.pm</tt> very
				carefully and make a module like it to collect your data.
				It's not too hard, but it might not be worth the effort --
				consider using a simple Perl script to let you fetch the
				data via the <tt>exec</tt> method. See the
				<tt>http-performance</tt> sub-tree for an example of how to
				do this.
