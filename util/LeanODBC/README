README for LEANODBC
===================

Version 0.9 03-01-2001

This extension is a thin wrapper to a restricted subset of the ODBC 3.x API. 
It is not object-oriented and the functions share the same names as their 
ODBC 3.x counterparts. The restricted subset of the API only includes Core 
Interface functions for read-only operations.

Compiling
---------

This Perl extension includes a DLL which must be compiled using same version
of Perl with which it will run. This means that a version compiled with
ActiveState 5xx builds (Perl 5.00x) will not run with ActiveState 6xx builds 
(Perl 5.6).

To compile you must have the Microsoft Visual C++ command line tools
(compiler, linker, etc) installed and configured (i.e. run VCVARS32.BAT
included with the Visual C++ distribution) and the libraries odbc32.lib
and kernel32.lib included with Visual C++ 5.0 or greater.

Edit the file Makefile.PL and change the line:
    'LIBS'	=> ['-lc:\vc98\lib\odbc32.lib -lc:\vc98\lib\kernel32.lib'],
to match the paths of these libraries on your system.

Run:
   perl Makefile.PL
   nmake 


Installing
----------

Once the extension has compiled successfully, to install run:
   nmake install

This installs to the local machine. To install remotely, you can make an
ActiveState Perl Package and then use ppm. Follow the directions at
http://velocity.activestate.com/docs/ActivePerl/faq/ActivePerl-faq2.html.

Documentation
-------------

To make HTML documentation, run:
   pod2html LeanODBC.pm > LeanODBC.html

Testing
-------

Before running the test, you need to configure an ODBC Data Source to
point to the Northwind sample database included with Microsoft Office. Use
the ODBC Control Panel applet (under Administrative Tools on Windows 2000
by default). Create a data source named 'NORTHWIND' pointing to the Access
*.mdb file.

To run the test, use:
   nmake test

If you don't have Microsoft Office installed and you are familiar with
ODBC and SQL, you can modify the test.pl file to use an ODBC Data Source
in your environment.
