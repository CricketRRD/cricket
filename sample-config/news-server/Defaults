# a subtree to monitor innd, by

# this subtree is setup to fetch stats via ssh from
# a remote news server. To do this from the background,
# ssh authentication needs to be setup accordingly.
# If you are running Cricket on the same host as INN,
# then you can remove the references to remexec below.
