# Note that the following OIDs are sampling cells and

# target definitions, you need to adjust to make sure you
# are using cell counts.  For the Cascade Switches used here,
# defining rrd-max values is imperative because these devices
# send out bogus cell counter readings about once per week that
# will mess up graphs if you don't cap them off.
#
# Cell counts are actually a nice fit here - with a full OC-3 pipe,
# you can churn the counters in way less than 5 minutes, so this
# gives headroom with a more reasonable sampling interval.
