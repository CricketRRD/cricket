Collector:
	focus does not work right for directories not in top level
	focus does not work with an extra / on the dir name

Grapher:
	remove legend from GIFs
	think about fetching values in response to %fetch(ds)% syntax

Later:

figure out what's wrong with expires, decide on refresh

same-as tag for target-types, so that jpj can make a Cisco-7500-Router
same-as a Cisco-7200-Router. (proper handling of --default-- helps
obviate this need)

Search for ERR in grapher.cgi and implement reasonable
error notification.

Make it possible to add the MAX data to graphs. (MRTG 2 does them only for
old graphs... hmm.)

Add loop detection in expand* routines.

Make more things configurable via the HTML dict, to aid i18n.
(i.e. instead of hardcoding "Values at last update", get it from the
dict, if possible)

Add an include syntax. (Useful for i18n, and for building libraries
of target-types for novice users.)

make it possible for subtree sets to include other subtree sets.

figure out why colons are not allowed in target names and decide
what to do about it (currently, it's just documented).

There's a Perl module named FastTemplate that might make the HTML
display significantly more powerful.

Unify the repeated code between collector and rrd-tune.
