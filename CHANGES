New features, fixes in version 1.0.4

	Introducing the view dictionary! Views are now separate config
	tree entries. Going forward, the view tag in the targettype
	dictionary should specify a comma-delimited list of views that
	are defined in separate view entries. View entries support all
	non-datasource specific graph tags (aka graph --default-- tags)
	and view specific tags. The most important view specific tag is
	'elements' which specifies a comma-delimited or space-delimited
	list of data sources. Note that this change should not break
	existing config trees because the old targettype view tag syntax
	is still supported.

	listInterfaces has been updated (users of the contributed
	web site may recognize listInterfaces+). When upgrading from
	previous versions of Cricket, it is recommended that you
	review any scripts that call listInterfaces.

	The URL style is now selectable from cricket-conf.pl. Options
	are "classic" (what Cricket 1.0.3 did, default), "relative"
	(which uses relative URLs, for reverse proxy) and "pathinfo"
	(passes the target name as part of the URL path, which allows
	for using Apache <Location> access restrictions).

	It is possible to mark NaN samples in the graph with a colored
	background. This enabled via the view tag paint-nan (boolean value).
	WARNING: do not enable this if you use the STACK draw-as
	type anywhere in your graphs.

	Added an alternate SNMP interface, using net-snmp. See
	lib/alternate/snmpUtils.pm. Not recommended in its current
	incarnation for users of SNMP traps and threshold monitoring.
	On some systems, using it may speed up Cricket by 10-15%.

	Fix mtargets bugs w.r.t. MiXeD CaSe names (hopefully for good)
	[bug #521367]

	Fix graph scaling with explicit "bytes=false", which was
	misinterpreted by the graphing code.

New features, fixes in version 1.0.3

	The many disk accesses to the config database that collector
	uses are causing the collector to run slowly on sites with
	huge config trees. Starting with 1.0.3, the entire config
	tree is slurped into memory. This causes a significant speedup
	at the expense of collectors memory size. The database access
	method can be set to "lookup" in cricket-conf.pl to revert
	to the old behavior if collector memory footprint is of greater
	concern to you than its hammering on the disk.

	A new way of configuring Cricket has been added. It is now
	possible to create a file called cricket-conf.pl, which can
	either reside in the same directory as the grapher.cgi
	and collector scripts, or in /usr/local/etc. This should
	eliminate the need to edit grapher.cgi, and make life easier
	for people running Cricket on NT. The change should be
	backwards compatible, please file a bug on Sourceforge if it
	is not. A sample file is provided as cricket-conf.pl.sample.

	The implementation of the MAIL action tag for monitor thresholds
	is complete. New VarBinds added for SNMP trap monitor thresholds.
	Added a new monitor threshold type, quotient. Revised and extended
	monitor threshold documentation. Added "exact" monitor type.

	A new config option, show-path, was added that allows the
	display of the current path in the config tree with clickable
	links for easier backtracking. Defaults to "no".

	Support for SNMP version 2, as well as for the additional
	options that SNMP_Session now offers has been added to
	the sample-config/Defaults file. For existing installations,
	it is recommended you install the sample-config/Defaults into
	your cricket-config and merge your local changes in.
	If you do this, or if you install Cricket from scratch, you
	should use SNMP_Session version 0.80 or higher (it is
	recommended to upgrade SNMP_Session regardless, there were
	some rare but hard to diagnose bugs in versions prior to 0.78).
	The defaults are
		snmp-timeout = 2.0
		snmp-retries = 5
		snmp-version = 1
	If you know what you're doing, you could reduce the number of
	retries or the timeout, but this is not recommended. Existing
	Cricket users should first evaluate the effectiveness of
	the dead-SNMP-host detection that's new with 1.0.3 before
	mucking with the SNMP settings.

	Support for Windows Management Instrumentation on the Windows
	2000 Platform. Refer to doc/win2kwmi.html.

	The SNMP code now has intelligence built in to quickly
	skip a device that is down or otherwise doesn't respond.
	After two successive timeouts from the same host in one
	collector run, that host is considered down and subsequent
	targets on that device will be marked 'U' without checking.
	This avoids the syndrome where one device with a lot of
	targets can significantly slow down your collection
	process. If you need, you can increase MAXTRIES in
	lib/snmpUtils.pm. [patch #402839]

	The top level Defaults now sets rrd-min to 0 rather than
	undef. The default rrd-ds-type now is DERIVE instead of
	COUNTER. These changes prevent spikes in graphs. For the
	intrepid, Cricket can now monitor snmp-uptime in conjunction
	with using COUNTER (usage of snmp-uptime is not recommended
	unless you understand all possible causes of SNMP counter
	rollover; not all agent resets can be detected). [bug #209530]

	squid-proxy subtree Defaults file has changed. One
	more variable is being polled now (CurrentLRUExpiration)
	so you'll need to either recreate your old RRDs, or
	use add_ds from the RRD distribution's contrib directory
	to add a datasource to your existing RRD files.

	Some internal changes were made that should not be user
	visible (except perhaps by running faster in some cases).
	Most notably, the internal database types "D:" and "n:" are
	no longer generated.

	All files were made consistent in their indentation. We now
	use soft tabs exclusively, with a tab size of 4.

	RPN now allows negative constants, like in this magic which
	inverts a percentage from 0-100 to 100-0:
		100,-,-1,*
	Fixes bugs #472862 & # 450391.

	Portability: Some failures on AIX have been eliminated.
	More hardware platforms are supported by lib/RRD/Format.pm.

New features, fixes in version 1.0.2 (18-May-00):

	Fixed bug #104757, $clmxCode/max-color bugs.

New features, fixes in version 1.0.1 (18-May-00):

	Various small bugs fixed, related to mixed case names.

	Documentation split into smaller files and reviewed.

	First release from Sourceforge's CVS server.

	Assorted bugs and patches that were also integrated:

	bug 212204 compile: add config-dir name to output
	bug 202221 Fix for display of scaled values in mtargets
	bug 202262 Summary should show up at bottom (optionally)  [feature]
	bug 202266 mtargets and targets and multi-target2  [doc clarification]
	bug 202455 need to quote url passed to test-url
	bug 205504 collect-subtrees / subtree-times  [feature]
	bug 205559 integrate functions of run-subtree into collector
	bug 205560 collector log rolling for .time files
	bug 205595 Collector optimizations
	bug 206305 Persistent monitoring toggle
	patch 400218 cricket-0.72-current_path.patch
	patch 400282 cricket-0.72-showmax.patch (docs changes)
	patch 400431 lib/RRD/Format.pm had incorrect regex for supported
		archname (similar to bug 206166, and a couple of others)

New features, fixes in version 0.72 (23-Jan-00):

	Fixed a typo in one of the "fixed" split lines from the
	last release.

	Fixed a typo that makes scaled mtargets work right.

	Fixed the height-hint in the root Defaults file to match
	the height used by rrdtool-1.0.10.

	Fixed y-min/y-max code, hopefully once and for all.

	Directories named 'CVS' (exactly) in the config tree
	are ignored now.

	Collect-subtrees now makes the log directory if necessary.

	Minor documentation fixes to reference.html.

	Cleared up warnings when inst-names tag is missing.

New features, fixes in version 0.71 (09-Jan-00):

	This release has a minimal number of patches to fix
	the most pressing bugs reported to me in the last 4 months.

	It works with RRD Tool 1.0.10. You must upgrade your RRD Tool
	install to this version to use Cricket 0.71. (This is because some
	critical bugs have been fixed recently in RRD Tool.)

	If this version of Crikcet proves to be stable, it will be
	renamed 1.0. Future development will take place in 1.0.x
	releases, culminating in a 1.1 release. In general, three-digit
	releases will be development, two digit releases production.

	Here are the patches that have been applied to Cricket 0.70:
		Minor documentation fixes.
		A new avg() function to go with the sum() function.
		Scaling works right in multitargets now.
		Event names are case insensitive, as documented now.
		Comma and colon delimited lists now ALWAYS allow
			whitespace. Previously, rrd-tune was broken because
			of a split() that was too restrictive. All of these
			have been fixed.
		Cricket no longer gives RRD Tool input that crashes it.
		Support for various architectures added to Format.pm.
		Lots of changes to Monitor.pm, but it's still not ready for
			production use. Sorry.
		http-performance tests a slightly different URL

New features, fixes in version 0.70 (11-Aug-99):

	ATTENTION: You must use RRD Tool 1.0.x with Cricket 0.70
	and higher. Cricket now defaults to making PNG pictures,
	if you are using a 4.0 browser or better. If you really
	want GIFs (which are big and slow, now that GD has been
	lobotomized by Dr. Unisys), then you need to investigate
	the graph-format tag in the graph dictionary.

	Frobbed the quoting magic some. I think it was broken before.
	I think it is less broken now. If you see odd behavior, suspect
	quoting problems.

	Integrated a patch from Shannon Reis <sreis@fastlane.net>
	that adds avg/max display in. This adds an additional
	call to RRDs::graph. If you want it the old way, check
	out the tag named show-avg-max in the graph dict.

	backed out change related to lower-casing the
	target names in the targets and mtargets tags. What
	was I thinking?

	usrModemUsage script no longer tries to use
	common.pm.

	removed useless and confusing reference to domain
	in the routers subtree.

	made warnings work right in util/* again. Oops.

	made the mapping routines use collect=false when
	called from the collector. Note: if you set collect
	to 'false', the target will still show up in the grapher
	and if necessary, the instance will be mapped. This
	could cause warnings in the grapher, but they can be
	ignored.

New features, fixes in version 0.69 (16-Jul-99):

	A bunch of namespace fixes:
	The collector can again make directories when necessary.
	Instance mapping works. Lots of other fixes...

	Monitoring is now documented, and seems to work.
	Please read the description of the tag named
	'monitor-thresholds' and discuss this stuff on the
	mailing list. Javier Muniz, who wrote it, will be available
	to help us learn about it in the coming weeks.

	The new unknown-is-zero tag in the targets dictionary
	makes it possible to add together graphs which have unknown
	regions and not have the unknown regions blot out the entire
	graph.

New features, fixes in version 0.68 (09-Jul-99):

	Made it possible to use mixed case in mtargets and targets
	specifications.

	Integrated patch that makes y-min and y-max datasource-level.

	Added patches to make it work under NT (again).

	Significant changes to namespace usage to
	make it work under mod_perl. Search for mod_perl
	in reference.html for more info.

	Fixed sum() to work right.

	Fixes to make it work (sorta) under mod_perl.

	Fixed a minor bug related to iterating over
	results from the table walks done during
	instance mapping.

	Made the error message for an unmatched quote
	include the file and line number.

New features, fixes in version 0.67 (09-Jun-99):

	Fix: Added quoting to the inst tag to protect the
	argument of map() from eval.

	Fix: made overzealous warning from Perl
	(in Log.pm) go away.

	Fix: A vector instance with one element is now
	correctly treated like a fixed-instance scalar.
	If you didn't understand that, don't worry. What
	it means is that Cricket will Do the Right Thing.

	Fix: missed a conversion of expandString. Instance
	mapping now works again.

New features, fixes in version 0.66 (03-Jun-99):

	Fix: instance names are correctly shown in the title
	after visiting the instance seletor widget.

	New feature: target tag collect=false tells the
	collector to skip that target.

	Fix: all dictionaries are expanded with respect
	to the target dictionary, which seems to be more in
	line with how people thought it would behave.
	I'm not certain how people are going to use this,
	but if it makes people less confused, it's good, I
	guess.

	New feature: events. You can mark a graph with a
	vertical rule of any color to mark the time something
	of interest happened. Check out the new events target
	tag, and the event dictioanry. This requires Date::Parse,
	but you should have that anyway. If not, go to CPAN
	and get it.

	New feature: eval's during expansion. You can surround
	code you want eval'd with {} in a tag, and that will
	happen immediately after expansion. So this:
		snmp-port-2 = "%snmp-port% + 1"
	results in snmp-port-2 getting set to 162 (i.e. 161 + 1).
	Useful functions to make use of this will be coming
	to a release near you soon. In particular, there
	will be a snmpget() and a snmpwalk() that behave
	in ways that help make the config tree more compact.

	New feaute: directories can have descriptions which
	show up in directory selection list. See
	target tag directory-desc.

	SLIGHTLY INCOMPATIBLE CHANGE: I renamed the meta
	tag, since it makes more sense to call it
	'head-html' where it is used. Compare your existing
	root Defaults file to the one in sample-config
	and you'll see the change. See the docs for how you
	might use this to use stylesheets to override my
	terrible sense of style.

	Converter completely removed. If you have RRD files
	in pre 0.99 format, you'll need to use Cricket 0.65
	to convert them, then upgrade to later versions.

	The white in cricket-sm.gif is now transparent. And
	it's 20 bytes smaller. Cool.

	Added a new subtree for monitoring news servers.

	grapher.cgi will no longer fail on negative data.
	We now compute the si_unit using abs($value).

	Expansion is now working correctly in the target
	selector widget.

	There's a new trap subroutine in snmpUtils that
	makes it possible to specify OIDs in outgoing traps.

New features, fixes in version 0.65 (19-May-99):

	This is the paper-bag-over-my-head release.

	This fixes a big bug in the config tree system
	that made it unable to understand config trees
	deeper than two levels.

	There are also some minor fixes to ignore RCS
	files correctly.

New features, fixes in version 0.64 (18-May-99):

	Sorry I got a bit verbose this time... a lot of
	infrastructure stuff has been happening recently. Keep
	reading all the way... there are some incompatible
	changes in this release.

	This version was tested with RRD Tool 0.99.29.1.
	It should work with other 0.99.x releases of RRD Tool
	also.

	You need to have the Perl module named DB_File
	installed to use this release. It's relatively
	standard, but if you don't have it, go get it
	from CPAN. (See doc/beginner.txt for more info on
	CPAN.) You can check to see if you have it by executing:

		perl -MDB_File -e 'print $DB_File::VERSION, "\n"'

	New feature: Cricket operates off of a compiled
	form of the config tree, which is stored in a file
	named config.db in the root of your config tree.
	The collector will recompile this as necessary,
	but when you are making interactive changes to the
	config tree, you need to remember to recompile it
	yourself -- the grapher does not have the permissions
	it needs to recompile it. The grapher will set the
	variable auto-error with a warning about the out-of-date
	compiled form. If you have added that variable to your
	page-footer tag, you'll at least get a reminder message.
	(search for auto-error in sample-config/Default for
	an example).

	To recompile the config tree manually, run:
		$HOME/cricket/compile -base <config-tree-base>
	If your config tree is in ~/cricket-config, you can omit
	the -base argument, since that is the default.

	New feature: ds-sources can now return text information
	after an floating point number, and Cricket will correctly
	ignore the text and use only the number. See the EXEC
	example in the docs for how this might be useful.

	New feature: you can defeat the cache by hand editing the
	URL that points to the target display page. Add '&cache=no'
	onto the end of the URL. This is helpful when you are
	making changes to the graph dictionary, and you want to
	regenerate the graphs on demand to see your changes.
	Remember, however, that you still need to recompile the
	Config Tree after each change.

	INCOMPATIBLE CHANGE: collect-subtree is now named
	collect-subtrees. It reads a file named subtree-sets
	which is slightly different format. For one, you need
	to replace the "subtree foo" lines with "set foo". You
	also need to nae subtrees by their full path relative
	to the root of the config tree. For instance,
	"router-interfaces" becomes "/router-interfaces".

	INCOMPATIBLE CHANGE: the URLs used by the grapher
	are a bit different now. If you have saved bookmarks
	that jump into certain parts of the config tree,
	they might not work now. Check them, and fix them
	if necessary. (The target parameter is no longer
	rooted at the Unix root.)

	New subtrees: usr, for monitoring USR modem chassis.

	New utilities: generate-statics and pmlines.pm, a more
	flexible replacement for PM3lines. Note that the portmaster
	subtree may not be in sync with the utility anymore...
	I'm not a portmaster user, so I'm relying on patches from
	you guys.

	generate-statics is a cool little tool to take snapshots
	of the GIFs. Read about it in the util/README file.

	New feature: graph dict tag rrd-graph-args allows
	you to send arguments directly in to RRD Tool, which
	Cricket does not already send for you. A notable use
	of this would be to set colors on the graphs to something
	other than the default. See the docs for more info.

	I made the page-footer easier to override in subtrees.
	If you want to put something in the center pane
	replace the tag named contact with your stuff.

	New feature: if mtargets-ops is "sum()", it is replaced
	with the right number of plusses.

	Grapher.cgi is a big mother, and it takes a long time
	for Perl to parse it. It now redirects image requests
	through mini-graph.cgi, which is a tiny mother, which
	is fast to parse. This makes your webserver spend less
	time parsing Perl and more time spraying GIFs, which
	is a Good Thing. This may not work on NT. If not,
	comment out the line in grapher.cgi with "mini-graph.cgi"
	in it. (It's a substitution on the variable $me.)
	Please send patches to make this work on NT. :)
	You may need to add a new link in ~/public_html/cricket
	to point to mini-graph.cgi.

New features, fixes in version 0.63 (02-Apr-99):

	INCOMPATIBLE CHANGE: If you have installed previous
	versions, you need to compare your targetType
	lines to the ones in the sample-config tree and fix them.
	Basically, tags are no longer allowed to appear
	multiple times, instead they must appear once
	with a comma-delimited list inside quotes.

	Jeff Jensen gave us the kick butt routing subtree,
	which lets you watch BGP updates with Cricket.

	The paper I wrote for NetA 99 is in doc/neta-paper.

	A new smaller rrdtool.gif Tobi gave me a long time
	ago which I forgot to add.

	Various bugfixes to jpj's new mtargets thing.

	Fixed a goofy bug which made view get set wrong
	when there were targets with and without a view
	in the same directory.

	collect-subtrees processes all subtree sets if it
	was given no arguments. Also cleaned up an error
	message.

	We now set --base correctly when drawing graphs.
	We decide how to set it based on the bytes tag
	in the graph dictionary.

	Unspecified bug in VRULE generation for yearly graphs
	fixed. Russ is the man.

New features, fixes in version 0.62 (27-Mar-99):

	Fixed some bugs in getFormat.c that the Compaq (cough)
	Alpha let us notice. It now creates output suitable to
	cut and paste into lib/RRD/Format.pm. Yippee.

	atm-interfaces subtree was contributed by Alan.

	grapher.cgi is friendlier about a missing VERSION
	file. But you really _should_ still have it in the
	same directory that grapher.cgi is in.

	Added the new disable-short-desc tag, which
	can make more room in the target selection table
	by skipping the description column.

	Fixed the README to reflect a recursive diff for submitting
	patches. (jpj)

	Updated or created documentation for targets,
	targets-short-desc, targets-long-desc, mtargets,
	and mtargets-ops. (jpj)

	Implemented support for graphing multiple targets on
	the same graph using the mtargets tag. (jpj)

	Implemented basic support for graphing of arithematic
	operations on targets.  You can now graph the sum of
	multiple targets, as well as other operations! (jpj)

New features, fixes in version 0.61 (07-Mar-99):

	Interlaced now works as specified in the manual.
	Previously you had to use "interleaved", which is
	not what the docs said.

	You can specify the time at which a given measurement
	was taken. Search for XXX@YYY in the reference docs.

	Minor efficiency change in collector.

	Cricket can now send traps with the data it is collecting
	inside. This is useful if you happen to be running
	Netcool, and you've set things up correctly to
	escalate alerts holding data that violates
	certain thresholds. However, it is implemented to be
	flexible enough to later let us send data other places.
	See the docs for tag copy-to for more info.

	As part of the copy-to implementation, snmpUtils now
	knows how to send SNMP traps. Cool.

New features, fixes in version 0.60 (05-Mar-99):

	CHANGE REQUIRING YOUR INTERVENTION!!!
	Old versions of Cricket might not have set rrd-min
	and rrd-max correctly in your RRD files. In this
	version of Cricket, the values come from the
	datasource dictionary, and from the target dictionary.
	If they are present in the target dictionary, they override
	the ones in the datasource dictionary. Check
	your config now to make certain it's doing what you
	want, and then run rrd-tune to apply the values
	to your existing RRD's.

	support for Portmasters, via an EXEC script.

	support for FreeBSD.

	removed unused call to localtime from grapher.cgi

	listInterfaces no longer lets colons creep into target
	names.

	rrd-dump truncates C strings correctly now.

	More control over multitargets with targets-desc-long
	and targets-desc-short. (Thanks, jpj.)

	Datasource descriptions are now displayed in the order
	they occur on the graphs.

New features, fixes in version 0.59 (15-Feb-99):

	grapher now handles blank long-desc gracefully.

	grapher will attempt to put up an error message
	in a GIF (failed.gif) when it cannot give you
	a graph.

	Minor fix in options to handle unset $HOME better.

	Grapher debug level defaults to 'info' again.

	Multi-target supports instances now. The separator
	in the targets tag is now ";". This is not a backwards
	compatible change; if you were using targets before,
	you need to change it now. It's all still undocumented
	but it getting stable enough to document it.

	Fixed bug reated to inst not getting set and
	causing a warning.

	FAQ updated... keep those "dumb" questions coming! The
	only dumb question is one we don't document and learn
	from!

	RRD::Format now supports Linux again, and there's
	a nifty tool from Ed that makes it a no-brainer
	to port to new OS's. See the comments in RRD::Format.

New features, fixes in version 0.58 (05-Feb-99):

	FINALLY: Support for RRD 0.99.* (tested with 0.99.7)
	(only the RRDs (shared library) module, at this time)

	NOTE: You MUST edit your RRA definitions, if you will
	be creating new RRD's. (Do it now before you forget!!!)
	You need to add the x-files-factor into the RRA definition
	after the consolidation function. See the comments in the
	root Defaults file. (New users can simply copy sample-config
	as usual.)

	Collector will do auto-conversion from old-format RRD files,
	for all you old-timers. It works like this; run 'collector'
	by hand once with the option '-convert'. Any RRD files that
	need to be converted will be. You can run with '-convert' as
	often as you want -- it will only do the conversion once.
	You can also convert a file on demand using util/convert-file.
	The old files are left in the same directory as "foo.rrd.old".
	Using find to remove them would save a lot of disk space --
	if you trust the converter. :) The command is:

		find ~/cricket-data -name '*.old' -exec rm {} \;

	collect-subtrees now takes a -cf arg, which you can
	use to tell it to look at a different subtrees file.

	Fixed incorrect HTML entity in sample-configs/rotuers/Defaults.

	Cricket's version is now available in the HTML dictionary,
	in both it's long and short forms. You can see it in action
	in the newest root Defaults file, which puts the version number
	in the footer.

New features, fixes in version 0.57 (02-Feb-99):

	Sample config tree now contains Cricket logo and the RRD
	logo. You should definately upgrade your root Defaults file...
	the logos look cool!

	Changes cached expiration system to be real-time. This means
	no evil cron job (yeah), no permissions problems (yeah) and
	no possibility of incorrectly cached graphs. I think.

	Expansions on the target list pages are now handled
	correctly.

	Short-desc is used now in the aggregates and at the
	top of target pages.

	New tag: bytes, which tells si_unit to calculate the prefix
	using powers of 2 instead of 10. "bytes" is set to true for
	ifInOctets and ifOutOctets in the sample tree now.

	Ignores files like "#foo#", which emacs can leave behind
	as backups.

	Datasources were not actually case insensitve like the
	docs claimed they were. Now they are. (Rumor has it they
	aren't everywhere yet...)

	Fixed bugs related to instance lists with variable expansions
	in them. Also a bug related to quoting these guys.

	Fixed bug in the way micro symbol was displayed.

	RRD::Format now supports arch i86pc-solaris and MSWin32-x86.

	listInterface will quote more lines that need it (i.e.
	empty or whitespace only lines).

New features, fixes in version 0.56 (15-Jan-99):

	Documentation updated in various ways, including
	new features, new info on purging the GIF cache, and
	fixed typos.

	Made RRD::Format cross-architecture. Supports
	sun4-solaris and i386-linux. For tips on
	porting to other archtectures, see lib/RRD/Format.pm.

	Reworked Makefile to make a more better tarfile (writeable
	files, and no garbage in lib).

	Added a "rand" parameter to image URLs so that Netscape
	will let RRD decide what things should be cached. Search
	for "rand" in grapher.cgi to shut this off, if you are
	annoyed by the slightly longer load times.

	Added a caching mechanism to the graph drawing routine.
	The cache dir can be changed easily by editing the beginning
	of grapher.cgi. It will never hold more than 5 minutes worth
	of graphs, so /tmp should be appropriate. Clearing the
	cache is done by running grapher.cgi from cron with certain
	options. Search for "cache" in the documentation.

	Made collect-subtree strip leading whitespace from
	subtree names correctly.

	Taught listInterfaces and router-interfaces subtree
	about sub-interfaces. It turns out that some interfaces,
	like those related to PVC's on frame relay circuits,
	will not tell you the packet or error counts. So
	listInterfaces tries to mark those as "sub-interface"
	type interfaces, so that we don't try to fetch things
	that we can't get.

	New feature: inst-names will let you name the instances
	in a vector instance list. See documentation for details.

	New feature: the graph dict tag si-units=false will
	let you disable si_unit(), which turns 2000 in 2k. The
	scales of the graph will still have the SI transformation
	done to them.

	The instance selector widget is now formatted as a
	5 column table.

New features, fixes in version 0.55 (07-Jan-99):

	Various fixes to make it work better on NT.
	Documentation expanded.
	listInterfaces handles quoting right.
	Squid OIDs revisited. (Still might not be right...)
	Changed the layout of the time-navigation links some.
	Other minor bugfixes to the grapher and collector.

New features, fixes in version 0.54 (21-Dec-98):

	Made collect-subtree work right when there are two or more
	different users running it on the same machine. Also made
	it scan logs for errors.

	Made the collector more robust when making new RRD files.
	It reports useful stats again (# targets, amount of wall
	clock time).

	Fixed a stupid bug in RPN.pm that made it impossible to
	divide.

	Made grapher.cgi work with installs where RRD.pm
	needs to be installed in the local lib directory for
	some reason. Fixed bug in graphParam. Layed out datasources
	more nicely in HTML summary.

	Made regexp-based instance mapping work. Included
	an interesting example of how to use this feature.
	See sample-config/Defaults, and search for ^map.

	Added new switches subtree, which polls interesting things
	from a switch. This is relatively untested -- we use it here,
	but not in the exact form I am shipping. Please try it out
	and give me feedback.

	Resolved some questions in the docs.

	Added a new file datasource type. See docs for more info.

New features, fixes in version 0.53 (10-Dec-98):

	Fixed a bug in collector regarding creating new
	RRD files with more than one DS. This bug has been in
	since 0.50.

	Worked on the documentation some more, including more
	information about the graph dictionary.

New features, fixes in version 0.52 (10-Dec-98):

	SMRTG is now named Cricket. The website changed.

	There's a configure script that will take care
	of you if your Perl is not where mine is.

	Once RRD tool supports the -i (--interlaced) feature
	(a patch has been sent to Tobias) you will be
	able to use the "interlaced" attribute of the
	"graph --default--" dictionary to control the
	encoding of the GIF.

New features, fixes in version 0.51 (8-Dec-98):

	fixes to the squid-proxy subtree (already!)
	fixes to the http-performance tree
	actually implemented locking in collect-subtrees

	grapher.cgi:
		new feature lets you set the upper and lower bounds
		on graphs which have occasional spikes that you don't
		want to see. Set "y-max" to (for example) 3.0 to
		trim peaks higher than 3.0. Setting y-max or
		y-min will disable auto-scaling, so only use it when
		you mean it!

New features, fixes in version 0.50 (4-Dec-98):

	sample-config:
		squid-proxy subtree added

	all RRD users converted to use RRD module instead of talking
	over pipe.

	more complete documentation

New features, fixes in version 0.49 (21-Nov-98):

	sample-config
		lots of things added to show off various features

	grapher.cgi:
		new 'precision' attribute of graph dictionary lets you
		control the precision of the HTML summary for that
		datasource. Set it to "integer" for things which should
		be rounded to the nearest integer (like the number of
		modems in use).

		new "space" tag in graph dict that will let you
		override the space printed before units. (Useful
		for things like the degree mark.)

		case-sensitivity bugfixes related to datasource
		descriptions.

New features, fixes in version 0.48 (12-Nov-98):

	util/listInterfaces
		Now outputs ready-to-use SMRTG config files. (Thanks David!)

	util/ciscoDiscover
		An interesting contribution from Ed Bugg, which isn't
		quite working for me yet.

	limited multi-target support:
		if you have a target with a "targets" attribute in it,
		it is considered a multi-target. No data is collected
		for it, and when it is displayed, the grapher puts
		each of the graphs up one after another.

	grapher.cgi:
		scales and values in HTML and add prefixes to your
		units.

		shows fewer graphs by default, but gives you choices
		about which to show one you are looking at a graph.

	collector:
		easier to mess with the logging level. Use "-loglevel debug"
		to debug your config. Other options are 'info', 'warn',
		and 'error'.

New features, fixes in version 0.47 (8-Nov-98):

	THANKS:
		added a place to keep track of the help people
		are giving me... you guys make this process work!
		Keep it up!

	collect-subtrees:
		a replacement for the crufty old wrap-collector
		script. This understands the concept of subtree-sets, which
		makes it much easier to parallelize SMRTG (which you need
		to do if you are trying to poll thousands of targets).

	sample-config:
		new http-performance subtree which makes if possible
		for SMRTG to monitor webservers (and FTP servers too!)

	documentation:
		a few more tidbits, still need volumes more
		a tiny fix to the README -- the crontab entry was missing 55!

	collector:
		a bugfix related to making new RRD's

	grapher.cgi:
		now works on Netscape's webserver too!

New features, fixes in version 0.46 (4-Nov-98):

	collector
		handles oids right, for real this time. (really!)

	common:
		handleTarget is abstracted better to make adding new
		commands (like rrd-tune, see below) easier.

	grapher.cgi:
		pays attention to the size hints now (fixed bug)

		new long-desc and short-desc attributes of targets
		let you add text to the web pages describing the targets.

		new desc attribute for a datasource causes a description
		of the datasources to be added to the end of the graph page.

		we now use RRD::File to dig out the current values
		for the graphed variables.

		new attribute in graph dict called "unit". Uses this
		as the first choice in the summary -- will fall back to
		y-axis. See sample-config/routers/Defaults for an example.

	There is a new tool in util called rrd-tune. It traverses
	a config tree and tunes each RRD to the current settings
	for min, max, xff, and hearbeat. (Takes same args as collector).
	Run this on a target (or it's whole subtree, for now) after making
	a change to it's config.

New features, fixes in version 0.45 (30-Oct-98):

	Miniscule bit of Documentation!

	ConfigTree.pm
		more consisten --default-- behavior: works right across
			all TagValue items
		handles missing quotes (and other errors) slightly better
		now possible to nuke a key that you inherited

	grapher.cgi
		no longer uses path_info, since this doesn't seem to work
			with all webservers. (Thanks to David Koski
			<dkoski@noc.ns.itd.umich.edu> for his help diagnosing
			this.)

	collector
		handles raw oids in datasources correctly now
		fails gracefully in many more situations where
			the config tree is missing data

This file started with version 0.45.
