Thanks to Tobias Oetiker, the author of RRD, for his very
useful tool. Without RRD, Cricket would be useless. (And without
Cricket, RRD is still cool, but hard to use!) Tobias also
contributed the cool Cricket logo.

Thanks to WebTV Networks for letting me work on this tool.
If it's half as useful to others as it is to us at WebTV,
we've definitely made the network management world a better
place!

I can only justify spending time on this project as long as
WebTV gets new stuff for free in return. So I am indebted to these
contributors for making this project possible. These folks
